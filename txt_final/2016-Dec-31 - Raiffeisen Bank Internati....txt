Market development

Markets swayed by monetary policy

Developments in the money and capital markets continued to be dominated last year by international central bank policies. In the
spring of 2016, for example, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided among other things to expand its bond-buying program
from € 60 billion per month to € 80 billion, to offer banks funding through long-term refinancing operations, as well as to cut key
interest rates. The central bank made adjustments to its policy mix at its last meeting in 2016. The minimum remaining period for its
bond purchases was extended to the end of 2017, with the monthly volume to return to € 60 billion as of April 2017. Money
market rates fluctuated between the central bank's deposit rate and main refinancing rate over the course of last year, and were in
negative territory across all maturities since mid-January 2016. The yield on two-year German government bonds was already
negative in 2015, with yields at the short end continuing to fall in 2016. The yield on ten-year German government bonds came
down in the first half of 2016, due to falling inflation expectations and the increase in ECB bond purchases; however, started
increasing as of last autumn. In the US, the Fed raised its key rate range by 25 basis points to 0.50-0.75 per cent in December
after a one-year pause

According to preliminary data, real GDP in the euro area grew 1.7 per cent in 2016. Consequently, the upswing in the monetary
union continued, despite the fact that economic growth concerns repeatedly surfaced last year. Economic growth was driven
primarily by private consumption and to a lesser extent by government consumption and gross fixed capital formation. At the
country level, economic development continued to be highly varied. Whereas Spain's GDP expanded by 3.3 per cent, Italy
posted GDP growth of a mere 1.0 per cent. The average price level of consumer goods remained virtually unchanged in the euro
area during most of the year. The lack of general inflationary pressure on consumer goods was attributable to falling prices for
energy and imported goods. Only when energy prices increased towards the end of 2016 - compared to prior year levels - did
the inflation rate pull away appreciably from the zero per cent mark.

Austria's economy experienced a moderate upturn in 2016, with real GDP growing 1.5 per cent. Domestic demand was the main
pillar of economic growth. Private consumption benefited from the tax reform that went into effect at the beginning of 2016, and
equipment investment was comparatively dynamic. Construction investment expanded for the first time in a number of years. In
contrast, net exports did not support real GDP growth

The US economy had a weak start to 2016. This was primarily the result of unusually low inventory investment, as well as declin-
ing investment in mining and oil & gas exploration due to sharply lower commodity prices. These negative effects subsequently
subsided in the second half of the year, and the economy resumed its dynamic growth. In particular, private consumption grew at
an encouraging pace. Nevertheless, real gross domestic product increased only 1.6 per cent in 2016, due to the weak start to
the year.

China’s economic growth stabilized and is estimated to be 6.7 per cent for 2016. Although the government's economic support
initiatives are likely to have kicked in, these primarily benefited large state enterprises through infrastructure investment. Growth
impetus continued to come from the real estate sector.

Solid growth in CE and SEE, recession flattening out in Russia

The low and in some cases negative inflation rates in Central and Southeastern Europe [CE and SEE) and the ECB’s low interest
rate policy enabled key rates in the region to be kept at a low level last year. In a number of countries further monetary policy
easing measures were even taken or continued to be implemented. In Poland and Romania, moreover, fiscal growth stimuli sup-
ported private consumption

The CE region registered a somewhat weaker economic trend in 2016, with GDP growth at 2.7 per cent. Although CE continued
to benefit from solid economic growth in Germany, as well as from the recovery in the euro area and from expansionary monetary
policies in some CE countries, economic growth in CE came in below the previous year's level. One contributory factor was the
drop in investment activity owing to temporarily lower EU transfer payments into the region. Poland, the region’s growth engine,
lost considerable momentum and recorded 2.8 per cent year-on-year growth. Overall, however, the economic data indicates
balanced growth with solid export and dynamic domestic economic activity.

SEE reported strong economic growth of 3.9 per cent year-on-year in 2016. Once again, the Serbian and Croatian economies
significantly stepped up their pace of growth compared to the previous year. The Croatian economy benefited from political stabili-
zation. In Romania, household demand was stimulated by tax cuts. With GDP growth of 3.3 per cent, Bulgaria caught up some-
what with Romania. Overall, economic growth in SEE was at its strongest pace in several years. Although a portion of this growth

was attributable to temporary factors, it nonetheless underscores that the weak phase of previous years has been overcome.

Economic conditions in Eastern Europe (EE] improved in 2016. Russia benefited from a recovery in oil prices over the course of
the year. Prudent monetary and fiscal policy had a stabilizing effect but failed to deliver additional growth impetus. The recession
in Russia flattened out significantly, and economic output fell only 0.2 per cent year-on-year in 2016. Russia’s manufacturing sector
improved somewhat towards the end of last year, but private household demand remained weak. Ukraine’s economy bottomed
out in 2015 and returned to growth of 2.2 per cent in 2016. The Belarusian economy, which is heavily dependent on financial
support from and exports to Russia, remained in a persistent recession. Inflation rates in EE retreated from high levels amid more

stable exchange rate developments and weak domestic demand

Development of the banking sector in CEE

In 2016, many indicators exhibited a substantial recovery of the banking sector from the subdued levels of the previous year.
Positive trends in new lending or in asset growth continued in several CE and SEE countries in 2016 (e.g. in the Czech Republic,
Slovakia and Romania). The banking sector in Russia also recovered significantly. Nearly all banking markets in CEE now show a
comfortable loan/deposit ratio (well below 100 per cent for the most part), which represents a solid foundation for future growth
In addition, many challenging banking markets of recent years started posting considerable profits again at sector level in 2016
(e.g. Hungary, Romania, Croatia and Russia). In particular, leading foreign banks also significantly outperformed general market
trends in the challenging Eastern European banking markets (Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus). The positive profitability trend was
additionally supported by the sustained stabilization, or even a sharp drop, in non-performing loans (NPLs} in CE and SEE (with
significant differences at country level). Overall, the NPL ratio in CE and SEE fell from previously 8.3 per cent to 7.4 per cent in
2016 as a result. In view of the positive developments in CE and SEE, as well as the stabilization of NPLs and profitability in
Russia, return on equity in the CEE banking sector significantly increased above the comparable figure in the euro area again in
2016.

Banking sector in Austria

In 2016, the banking sector in Austria continued to perform below average when compared to the euro area in terms of credit
growth (notably in corporate banking). Lending focused on retail customer and real estate financing transactions in particular.
However, the profitability of Austria's banking sector markedly increased at a consolidated level, mainly supported by CEE busi-
ness. As a result, the Austrian banking sector also significantly improved its capitalization relative to major Western European
countries. However, the reported regulatory capital ratios continue to be below average by international standards. If the lever-
age ratio is included as benchmark, Austrian banks performed remarkably better. Capital requirements will gradually increase
following the introduction of the Systemic Risk Buffer as well as of the buffer for Other Systemically Important Institutions (O-Slls),
which the Financial Market Stability Board (FMSB) has recommended. The reduction in the bank tax from 2016 should also have
a positive impact in the following years.

The Sustainability Package, which was launched in 2012, has helped to strengthen the local funding base of Austrian subsidiary
banks in CEE. The loan/deposit ratio fell from 117 per cent in 2008 to 88 per cent in the first quarter of 2016, and was primarily
attributable to an increase in local savings deposits. Accordingly, credit growth is increasingly financed on a local basis.

The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) became fully effective on 1 January 2016. The Single Resolution Board (SRB} is the
central body responsible for making all decisions relating to the resolution of major banks that are either failing or at risk of failing
The measures are implemented in cooperation with the relevant national resolution authorities.

In the first half of 2016, the Austrian banks generated a positive consolidated net income of roughly € 2.9 billion, or € 0.3 billion
more than in the same period of the previous year. The positive result was mainly driven by the sharp reduction in loan loss provi-
sions, which not only more than offset significant declines in net interest income as the most important income component, but also
lower income from commissions and net trading income. The profitability of Austrian subsidiary banks in CEE significantly improved
in the first quarter of 2016. Profit contributions from Austrian subsidiary banks were positive in all CEE countries. The highest profits
were made in the Czech Republic, Romania and Russia, albeit with profits down in Russia in comparison with the previous year's
quarter.

Regulatory environment

Changes in the regulatory environment

The Group focused intensively on current and forthcoming regulatory developments again in the year under review.
Proposed legislation relating to the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS)

In 2015, the European Commission proposed a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS} designed to support the banking
union, strengthen the protection of depositors, increase financial stability, and further weaken the link between banks and sover-
eigns. The EDIS is part of the European SRB and covers all national deposit guarantee systems (including IPS} and is to be devel-
oped incrementally in three stages by 2024. In the first stage it is to comprise a reinsurance scheme of the national deposit
guarantee systems and subsequently become a co-insurance scheme after three years, under which the contribution of the EDIS is
to progressively increase over time. A fully comprehensive EDIS is planned as the last stage, which is scheduled for 2024. The
final adoption and publication of the law is lined up for the fourth quarter of 2017 at the earliest.

Bank recovery and bank resolution

The Austrian Bank Recovery and Resolution Act (Bankenabwicklungs- und Sanierungsgesetz [BaSAG}} went into force in 2015
and ensures the national implementation of the EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive from 2014. With regard to recovery
planning under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Group is subject to direct supervision by the ECB while, with re-
gard to resolution planning under the SRM, it is subject to direct supervision by the SRB.

The Group has drawn up a recovery plan that meets the requirements of the BaSAG. The recovery plan describes potential
measures for ensuring the capacity to act in financial stress situations. With the help of material key performance indicator (KPI)
monitoring for early detection, the recovery plan establishes a comprehensive governance structure for stress situations. The recov-
ery plan is drawn up by the Group, updated on a regular basis and reviewed by the supervisory authority (ECB]

Resolution plans are drafted by the resolution authority, which also grants powers to remove any barriers to resolution. Resolution
strategies for banks are likewise laid down in the resolution plans. As part of the framework for the resolution of banks, specific
resolution tools are made available to the resolution authorities. For example, the Group - already prior to the introduction of the
Austrian Bank Intervention and Restructuring Act (Banken Interventions- und Restrukturierungsgesetz (BIRG)) and the BaSAG -set
limits on intra-Group relationships in order to reduce cluster risk and unrestricted residual risk both to itself and to its owners.

In addition to preparing resolution plans, the obligation to comply with an MREL (Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and
Eligible Liabilities) is also determined and individually specified for each bank/resolution entity. The Group is currently working in
close cooperation with the SRB and national resolution authorities to draw up a resolution plan that meets the statutory require-
ments. The participation of creditors [bail-in tool) represents one possible tool in a resolution concept. As a result, the resolution
authorities will set the MREL. On the basis of the resolution strategy, an MREL is set for each bank/resolution entity or the entire
banking group. The calibration of MREL targets is to be carried out by the supervisory authorities and is based on relevant statuto-
ry regulations, resolution plans, as well as individual aspects of the respective bank (e.g. size, business model and risk profile}
Not only a bank's regulatory capital but also its long-term unsecured debt that is not subject to a deposit protection scheme or
similar restrictions are basically considered to be eligible for MREL.

Amendment to European regulations

In November 2016, the European Commission published a legislative proposal to change the prudential requirements (CRD
IV/CRR}, as well as to amend the recovery and resolution framework [BRRD, SRM]. The documents provide the basis for follow-up
negotiations with the EU Parliament and European Council and at the same time offer a preview of the regulatory challenges for
the years following 2017,

On the one hand, the proposed changes to the CRR can be broken down thematically into criteria for classification under the
finalized Basel Ill. This comprises, for example, the introduction of a binding minimum leverage ratio and net stable funding ratio
(NSFR}, as well as add-ons to the bank recovery and resolution regulations, in order to meet the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity
(TLAC) requirements for global systemically important banks. On the other hand, the drafts include adjustments whose content
already relates to Basel IV, e.g. the introduction of a standardized approach for measuring counterparty risks, an overhaul of
market price risk regulations within the framework of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) and new rules for invest-
ment funds. Compared to the previous implementation of Basel standards, it is clearly evident that proportionality is given far
greater weight, in particular, to meet the needs of the numerous smaller banks in the EU. According to the latest information, the
new tules and regulations are expected to be applicable from 2019 onwards

Action plan for building a capital markets union

The European Commission aims to improve access to capital market funding for all companies, especially small and mediumsized
enterprises (SMEs). It wants to break down barriers that are blocking cross-border investments on the capital market. The action
plan of 30 September 2015, provides for a bundle of measures through to 2017, including specific legislative proposals relating
to securitization and consultations on covered bonds. The work packages for the action plan were processed and/or expedited
in 2016. While the fundamental aim of driving cross-border investments is certainly to be welcomed, it cannot provide a realistic
alternative to credit financing for SMEs through banks. Instead, the proposed measures can arguably only be considered as
measures to supplement financing by banks

Earnings and financial performance

The consolidated financial statements of RBI are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as applied in the EU. RBI AG also prepares individual financial statements in accordance with the Austrian Commercial
Code (UGB) in conjunction with the Austrian Banking Act (BWG), which provide the formal basis of assessment for calculating

Significant events
Merger of RBI AG and RZB AG

On 5 October 2016, the Management and Supervisory Boards of RBI AG and RZB AG passed in principle a resolution to
merge RBI AG and RZB AG. The respective Extraordinary General Meetings of the participating companies subsequently ap-
proved the merger by a clear majority in January 2017. Accordingly, the merger of RZB AG into RBI AG will become effective in
the first quarter of 2017 with its entry in the commercial register. Consequently, reporting will be prepared on the basis of the
combined bank as of the first quarter of 2017. The Company will continue to operate under the name of Raiffeisen Bank Interna-
tional AG, and RBI shares will remain listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The shareholding of the RBI free float will be

41.2 per cent following the merger. The regional Raiffeisen banks will hold approximately 58.8 per cent of RBI shares. There is a
related syndicate agreement that contains, among other things, lock-up provisions.

Following the merger, the Group's risk-weighted assets (total RW/A} would increase 13 per cent to € 68 billion (pro forma as at
the end of 2016). The common equity tier 1 ratio (transitional) of the merged entity, based on a pro forma calculation, would be
12.7 per cent as at the end of 2016, with a common equity tier 1 ratio (fully loaded) of 12.4 per cent.

Transformation program

The sale of Raiffeisen-Leasing Polska S.A., Warsaw, to PKO Leasing S.A., Warsaw, was closed on 1 December 2016. The pur-
chase price was € 193 million. Including reclassified realized currency effects, this led to a positive impact of approximately

18 million on RBI's consolidated profit in the fourth quarter. The transaction also resulted in an improvement of 33 basis points in
RBI's CET] ratio (fully loaded). RWA decreased around € 1,272 million

Negotiations with Alior Bank S.A. on the sale of the core banking business of Raiffeisen Bank Polska S.A. (Raiffeisen Polbank)
were terminated on 7 December 2016. As agreed with the regulator, RBI is now preparing to list a 15 per cent stake in Raiffeisen
Polbank in an initial public offering, while also working on rightsizing the business model.

Following the inconclusive sales process relating to ZUNO BANK AG, parts of the existing business are being integrated into the
subsidiary banks in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Itis planned to complete the integration by the middle of 2017.

As part of the planned reduction in RWA, significant progress has been made in Asia since the end of 2014, with RWA scaled
back by approximately 84 per cent to € 395 million. The winding down of the US operations is also making good headway, with
a decrease in RWA of circa 66 per cent to € 347 million since the end of 2014. The remaining business is now being run down;
branches in Asia and business outlet in the US are being reduced to a minimum, and no longer conduct active business.

As a result of the measures described, RBI reached its CET] ratio (fully loaded) target of at least 12 per cent by the end of 2017,
ahead of schedule, and significantly exceeded it with a ratio of 13.6 per cent (fully loaded) at the end of 2016. The transfor
mation program was thereby completed ahead of time, and the Non-Core segment is to be dissolved as of the beginning of
2017. The remaining business will be integrated into the existing segments.

Merger of Group parent companies

RBI's former ultimate parent company, Raiffeisen-Landesbanken-Holding GmbH, Vienna, and its wholly owned subsidiary
Rlandesbanken-Beteiligung GmbH, Vienna, in which 82.4 per cent of the shares in Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG were
pooled, were merged into Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG at the end of September 2016. The latter will thus serve as
ultimate parent company of RBI up until its merger into RBI, forming a consolidated group. Once RZB AG is merged into RBI AG,
then RBI AG itself will be the ultimate parent company.

Revision of bank levy regulation in Austria

In July 2016 the Austrian government reached an agreement to amend the bank levy regulation from 2017 onwards. The amend-

ment includes a reduction in the annual bank levy; at the same time, Austrian banks are to make a one-off payment. For the merged
Group this will amount to around € 163 million. This payment will be spread over a four-year period, starting in 2017. The Austrian
bank levy came to approximately € 85 million for RBI in 2016 [€ 1 million less than in 2015). Starting in 2017, the amount will be
around € 58 million per year for the merged Group, including the proportional share of the one-off payment, until 2020.

Overview of the financial year

In addition to the persistently low interest rate level, which also resulted in a decline in RBI's operating result, the financial year was
primarily influenced by significantly lower impairment losses on loans and advances. In CEE, nearly all markets registered declines.
Also in Asia, impairment losses were € 118 million lower than in the previous year. Net provisioning for impairment losses fell

AO per cent yearonyear, or € 509 million, to € 754 million. The largest declines occurred in Ukraine, Asia and at Group head
office. Consolidated profit amounted to € 463 million and improved 22 per cent year-on-year, or € 84 million

Operating income was down 5 per cent year-on-year, or € 237 million, to € 4,692 million. A portion of the decline was attribut-
able to currency devaluations in Eastern Europe. Net interest income fell 12 per cent, or € 391 million, to € 2,935 million. This
was primarily attributable to continuing low market interest rates in many of the Group's countries, existing excess liquidity, and a
reduction of € 215 million, particularly in Russia, in interest income from derivatives entered into for hedging purposes. Despite the
currency devaluations in Eastern Europe and lower sales in Central Europe, net fee and commission income declined only

1 per cent, or € 22 million, to € 1,497 million. Net trading income rose € 198 million year-on-year to € 215 million. Net income
from currency-based transactions improved by € 176 million to € 116 million, primarily as a result of a more limited devaluation of
the Ukrainian hryvnia than in the previous year (€ 81 million increase]

General administrative expenses were down 2 per cent year-on-year, or € 66 million, to € 2,848 million. On the one hand, this
decline was attributable to currency devaluations in Eastern Europe; on the other, deposit insurance fees were lower (€ 34 million}
mainly in Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Bulgaria. In addition, office space expenses fell € 26 million because of
branch closures. Expenses were increased by expenditures for the bank resolution fund (up € 10 million] and for IT (up

€ 6 million). Staff expenses rose | per cent, or € 20 million, to € 1,410 million. Cost savings from the workforce reduction of

7 per cent were set against increases from the purchase of Citibank’s retail business in the Czech Republic and from growth in
Slovakia. Furthermore, no bonuses for the year 2014 were paid in 2015, which resulted in a release of provisions totaling ap-
proximately € 76 million. This effect was absent in the 2016 financial year.

The average number of staff was further reduced, down 3,906 year-on-year to 50,186. The number of business outlets de-
creased 199 yearonyear to 2,506

In the course of the year, total assets fell 2 per cent, or € 2,563 million, to € 111,864 million. Changes in the scope of consoli-
dation were responsible for around € 2,400 million decline in consolidated total assets, which resulted primarily from the sale of
the Polish leasing business and of the Slovenian subsidiary bank. Currency developments ~ predominantly the appreciation of
the Russian rouble (up 25 per cent) and the US dollar against the euro (up 3 per cent} - resulted in an increase of around

€ 1,700 million.

Equity including capital attributable to non-controlling interests increased 9 per cent, or € 731 million, to € 9,232 million. In-
creases resulted from profit after tax of € 574 million and other comprehensive income of € 190 million. Exchange rate differ
ences represented the largest item in other comprehensive income and amounted to € 291 million in the reporting period (2015:
minus € 194 million}

In terms of regulatory capital, the key metrics changed as follows: Common equity tier 1 (after deductions) was € 8,339 million at
the end of the year, a € 668 million increase over the 2015 comparable figure. Total capital pursuant to the CRR came to

11,537 million, which corresponds to an increase of € 550 million compared to the 2015 yearend figure. Total risk-weighted
assets were down € 3,212 million to € 60,061 million, as a result of the sale of the Slovenian subsidiary bank and the Polish
leasing business, as well as due to rating improvements in Ukraine and Belarus. Based on total risk, the common equity tier | ratio
(transitional) was 13.9 per cent while the total capital ratio (transitional) was 19.2 per cent. Excluding the transitional provisions as
defined in the CRR, the common equity tier | ratio (fully loaded) stood at 13.6 per cent, and the total capital ratio [fully loaded)
was 18.9 per cent

No dividend will be distributed for the 2016 financial year, to continue to sustainably strengthen the capital ratio

Operating income

Net interest income

In 2016, net interest income declined 12 per cent, or € 391 million, to € 2,935 million. This was primarily attributable to continu-
ing low market interest rates in many of the Group's countries, existing excess liquidity, and a reduction of € 215 million, particular-
ly in Russia, in interest income from derivatives entered into for hedging purposes. This was a result of the lower interest rates in
2016 (the interbank interest rates were exceptionally high in Russia in the first half of 2015) and of a lower volume of USD swaps.
The decline in loan portfolios in Asia also contributed to the reduction in net interest income; across the Group, the volume of
interest-bearing assets declined 5 per cent.

ed a volumerelated rise of € 12 million. In the Southeastern
3.24% Europe segment, net interest income fell 5 per cent, or
3.11% € 42 million, to € 738 million. All countries in this segment -

Russia, due to a € 175 million reduction in interest income from
derivatives. In contrast, margins from the core business improved
significantly, especially on the liabilities side. In Ukraine, the 3
per cent, or € 5 million, decline in net interest income to
rr € 171 million was currency related, whereas in local currency
terms, net interest income rose 14 per cent. In Belarus, net
interest income increased € 3 million to € 128 million. In the
Non-Core segment, however, net interest income fell 14 per cent, or € 54 million, to € 331 million, with Asia reporting the largest
decline of 56 per cent, or € 47 million, to € 37 million due to reduced volumes. In the USA, net interest income fell € 11 million to
€ 14 million, due to the reduction in business volumes. In contrast, in Poland, repricing measures in the deposit business increased
net interest income by 4 per cent, or € 9 million, to € 262 million

The Group's net interest margin declined 22 basis points year-on-year to 2.78 per cent, of which a reduction of 6 basis points
was due to exchange rate effects in the Eastern Europe segment. The decline in the net interest margin was attributable to the
aforementioned low market interest rates, especially in the Central Europe and Southeastern Europe segments. In addition, the
business volume [average interest-bearing assets) was down 5 per cent.

Net trading income

Net trading income increased € 198 million year-on-year to € 215 million. Currency-based transactions rose € 176 million to
16 million, primarily as a result of a more limited Ukrainian hryvnia devaluation than in the previous year (€ 81 million in-
crease}. Another positive effect was attributable to the discontinuation of a hedging transaction for Russian rouble denominated

dividend income, which had resulted in a € 70 million reduction in the previous year. Net trading income also increased as a
result of valuation gains on derivatives and foreign currency positions in Russia (€ 13 million increase) and Croatia (€ 6 million
increase). In contrast, Group head office (down € 82 million) and Belarus (down € 61 million) reported declines resulting from
lower net income from open foreign currency positions due to valuations and volumes and to the termination of a strategic curren-
cy position. Net income from interest-based business rose € 51 million to € 119 million, primarily due to valuation gains and
higher interest income from derivatives and securities positions at Group head office. In contrast, net income from equity and
index-based transactions fell € 25 million to minus € 18 million, as a result of an adjustment of the yield curve due to changed
market conditions

Recurring other net operating income

Recurring other net operating income decreased € 21 million yearonyear to € 45 million. This included a € 13 million decline in
net income from the allocation and release of other provisions, caused by higher allocations for litigation in Slovakia. Net income
from investment property fell € 7 million, predominantly due to the disposal of a Group unit in the Czech Republic.

General administrative expenses

The Group's general administrative expenses were down 2 per cent, or € 66 million, to € 2,848 million in the reporting period
The cost/income ratio increased 1.6 percentage points to 60.7 per cent due to lower operating income.

Staff expenses

Staff expenses, which constituted the largest item within general

dminishative expenses (50 per cent], increased | per cent, or COSt/income ratio performance

€ 20 million, to € 1,410 million. Following the decision not to in € million

pay a bonus for 2014, bonus provisions of € 76 million were

released in the previous year. The Czech Republic reported an 5297 GD 50

increase of € 27 million, primarily driven by higher staffing ; 1 en

levels following the purchase of Citibank’s retail business. In 596 E- Pee

Slovakia, staff expenses rose € 9 million and was also due to
increased staffing levels. At Group head office, staff expenses
grew € 7 million as a result of an increase in staffing levels and
salary adjustments. Staff expenses fell in Russia [down € 14 p24 8.48
million) due to a reduction in staffing levels and to currency
effects. In Asia, staff expenses were down € 5 million due to
reduced staffing levels.

The average number of staff (fulltime equivalents) fell 3,906
yearonyear to 50,186. The largest declines occurred in Ukraine

(down 1,728}, in Poland (down 1,143) due to the sale of the 3012 +9013”~«DO1A””” 2201S” 2006

and in Hungary (down 1.50). The largest increases occurred in #=Cosi/ncome aio

the Czech Republic (up 341] and in Slovakia (up 154)

Other administrative expenses

Other administrative expenses decreased 6 per cent, or € 66 million, 10 € 1,107 million. The decline was largely driven by lower
deposit insurance fees [down € 34 million], primarily in Poland, in the Czech Republic, in Romania, and in Bulgaria. Office space
expenses also fell [down € 26 million] due to branch closures. The number of business outlets was down 199 to 2,506 compared
to yearend 2015. The most significant declines occurred in Ukraine (down 80], Poland (down 58], Romania down 32), and in
Slovenia due to the sale of the subsidiary bank {down 13). Communication and car expenses also declined, whereas contribu-
tions to the bank resolution fund increased € 10 million and IT expenses grew € 6 million

Depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed assets

Depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed assets fell 6 per cent year-on-year, or € 20 million, to € 331 million. The most
significant decline occurred in Hungary, which reported impairment charges in the previous year as a result of branch closures
[€ 5 million) and in relation to software (€ 7 million). Ukraine also reported a decline of € 10 million, following impairment charg-
es in relation to buildings and the brand in the previous year. The impairment charge in relation to the Polbank brand amounted to
€ 21 million in the previous year, with the remaining € 26 million written down in the year under review. An increase was reported
in Russia, where investments in software and licenses resulted in higher depreciation

The Group invested € 384 million in fixed assets in the reporting period. Of that amount, 36 per cent (€ 137 million) was invested
in own tangible assets. Investments in intangible fixed assets - mainly related to software projects - accounted for 42 per cent.
The remainder was invested in assets in the operating leasing business.

Net provisioning for impairment losses

Net provisioning for impairment losses declined 40 per cent overall yearonyear, or € 509 million, to € 754 million. This included
a € 555 million reduction in individual loan loss provisions to € 769 million, while net releases for portfolio-based loan loss provi-
sions declined € 45 million to € 4 million. Proceeds from the sale of impaired loans remained almost unchanged at € 10 million

The majority of net provisioning for impairment losses in the reporting year was attributable to corporate customers, for which
provisions of € 506 million were required. The figure for retail customers was € 237 million, of which € 88 million related to the
switch to a rating-based model (PD/IGD] to calculate portfolio-based loan loss provisions, which had commenced in the previous
year. An amount of € 28 million was already reported in the previous year.

The largest decline in net provisioning for impairment losses was recorded in Ukraine, which reported a net release of € 2 million
compared to a net provisioning requirement of € 212 million in the previous year. This was because higher allocations for retail
and corporate customers were still necessary in the previous year, due to the economic situation in the Donbass region, and
because currency effects had a reduced influence in the reporting period. In Asia, net provisioning for corporate customers
amounted to € 179 million, € 118 million less than in the previous year. In the Group Corporates segment, net provisioning for
impairment losses for large corporate customers also fell € 66 million to € 74 million. Hungary reported a net release of € 7
million, compared to net provisioning for impairment losses of € 56 million for corporate and retail customers in the previous year.
The decline was due in particular to sales of non-performing loans collateralized with real estate and to rating improvements of
corporate customers. The credit risk situation for corporate and retail customers also improved in Russia, where net provisioning for
impairment losses amounted to € 145 million, € 36 million less than in the previous year. In Bulgaria, the settlement of several
corporate customer non-performing loans resulted in a decline of € 32 million, with no net provisioning requirement in the report-
ing year. Albania was the only country where the situation was different, with the default of several large corporate customers
resulting in a € 34 million increase to € 65 million

The significant credit risk improvement is also reflected in the portfolio of non-performing loans, which fell € 1,843 million to
€ 6,486 million during the year. The reduction was primarily attributable to sales of non-performing loans (€ 1,187 million), while
the remainder of the decline was largely due to the derecognition of uncollectible loans. Currency effects resulted in a € 52
million rise. The largest declines occurred in Group Corporates (down € 587 milion), Ukraine (down € 299 million), Hungary
[down € 252 million), Group Markets (down € 233 million], Russia (down € 152 million), Slovenia (down € 121 million as a
result of the sale of the Slovenian subsidiary bank), Bulgaria [down € 77 million) and Croatia (down € 72 million). The NPL ratio
declined 2.7 percentage points year-on-year to 9.2 per cent. Non-performing loans compared to loan loss provisions amounting
to € 4,905 million. Despite the sales and write-offs, the NPL coverage ratio improved from 71.3 per cent to 75.6 per cent.

The provisioning ratio - net provisioning for impairment losses in relation to the average volume of loans and advances to custom-
ers - fell 0.59 percentage points year-on-year to 1.05 per cent.

Other results

Net income from derivatives and liabilities

Net income from derivatives and liabilities declined € 184 million to minus € 189 million. This reduction was primarily due to net
income from changes in credit spreads for own liabilities, which fell € 116 million to minus € 119 million due to lower risk premi-
ums for RBI. Net income from the valuation of derivatives entered into for hedging purposes fell € 68 million.

Net income from financial investments

Net income from financial investments improved € 84 million year-on-year to € 153 million. This was primarily attributable to net
proceeds from the sale of equity participations, which rose € 144 million yearon-year to € 145 million. The sale of Visa Europe
shares to Visa Inc. in June 2016 resulted in proceeds of € 132 million, of which € 78 million was transferred from other compre-
hensive income. Impairment charges relating to equity participations fell € 28 million in the reporting year to € 18 million. In
contrast, the valuation result for securities in the fair value portfolio declined € 59 million to € 16 million, mainly due to significantly
lower valuation results on fixed income government bonds linked to the US dollar in Ukraine. Net income from the sale of securi-
ties from the fair value portfolio also fell € 23 million. This decline was primarily due to the sale of Icelandic bonds at Group head
office in the previous year.

Bank levies and non-recurring effects

The expense for bank levies rose € 39 million yearon-year to € 158 million. The increase was primarily due to expenses of
€ 34 million for the newly:introduced bank levy in Poland

The “Walkaway Law” came into force in Romania in the second quarter of 2016. The expected utilization resulted in a provision-
ing requirement of € 27 million in the reporting period. The new mortgage loan law stipulates that borrowers can sign their prop-
erties over to banks and thereby settle their debts, even if the outstanding volume of the loan exceeds the value of the property.
The law relates to certain mortgage loans taken out by private individuals in any currency and applies retroactively. Since the
Group is of the opinion that this contravenes the Romanian constitution, corresponding proceedings were initiated. In October
2016, the Romanian Constitutional Court repealed sections of the law connected with its retroactive application

A provision of € 67 million was released in the previous year in connection with the implementation of the adjustments required in
2014 under the Settlement Act in Hungary, and a further € 7 million was released in the reporting period

In Croatia, a law to enforce the conversion of loans denominated in Swiss francs resulted in a negative one-off effect of
€ 77 million in the previous year (2016: minus € 10 million). Proceedings initiated by the banks against the Croatian govern-
ment challenging the constitutionality of the law are pending

Net income from the disposal of Group assets

The disposal of 16 subsidiaries resulted in net income of € 19 million in the reporting year, mainly from the sale of the Polish
leasing company. Net income of € 41 million was recorded in the previous year as a result of the exclusion of 28 subsidiaries
from the consolidation group. Proceeds of € 86 million from the sale of the 75 per cent stake in the Russian pension fund business
ZAO NPF Raiffeisen, Moscow, were offset by an impairment of € 52 million in respect of assets available for sale in connection
with the sale of the Slovenian subsidiary bank Raiffeisen Banka d.d., Maribor. Of the 16 subsidiaries excluded in the reporting
year, nine companies were excluded due to immateriality, six as a result of their sale and a further one due to a change in control
The companies were predominantly active in leasing, financing and banking business, and as suppliers of ancillary services

Income taxes

Income taxes increased € 36 million, or 13 per cent, year-on-year to € 312 million. The increase was predominanily the result
of the write-off of tax receivables from prior periods in Poland and the return to positive results from a tax perspective in Ukraine
and in Croatia. At 35 per cent, the effective tax rate in the reporting year was significantly above the Austrian income tax rate of
25 per cent. This was largely attributable to expenses which are non-deductible for tax purposes mainly in Russia, in the Czech
Republic, at Group head office and in Ukraine, as well as to loss carryforwards which cannot be capitalized for tax purposes at
Group head office and in Hungary.

Net interest income

Compared to the third quarter of 2016, net interest income rose 2 per cent, or € 16 million, to € 748 million in the fourth quarter.
The net interest margin (calculated on interestbearing assets) increased 6 basis points from the previous quarter to 2.83 per cent.
The primary cause of this positive development was the € 21 million increase in interest income from loans and advances to
customers, predominantly in Russia and at Group head office.

Net fee and commission income

Net fee and commission income grew 6 per cent compared to the third quarter, or € 22 million, to € 400 million. The increase
was based in part on exchange rate movements in Eastern Europe, but was largely due to volume effects. Net income from the
payment transfer business posted the largest increase, up 5 per cent, or € 9 million, to € 176 million, due to higher fee and com-
mission income driven by volumes and margins in Russia, at Group head office and in Romania. Net income from the loan and
guarantee business improved by € 7 million to € 46 million, due to higher guarantee income at Group head office and higher
volumes, notably in Russia and in the Czech Republic. Net income from the foreign currency, notes/coins and precious metals
business rose € 6 million to € 105 million, particularly at Group head office and in Poland

Net trading income

Compared to the previous quarter, net trading income improved € 27 million to € 78 million. Net income from currency-based

transactions increased € 21 million to € 44 million, primarily due to exchange rate-related valuation gains on foreign currency

positions and on derivatives at Group head office, at Raiffeisen Centrobank and in Russia. This was set against valuation losses
from foreign currency positions, notably in Ukraine and Asia. Net income from equity and index-based transactions posted a

€ 6 million increase as a result of higher levels of activity in securities trading, as well as positive valuation effects in connection
with changed market conditions.

Recurring other net operating income

Recurring other net operating income fell € 28 million in the fourth quarter to minus € 4 million. This was primarily attributable to
net income from the allocation and release of other provisions, which was down € 8 million due to a provision made for litigation
in Slovakia, and net proceeds from the disposal of tangible and intangible fixed assets, which declined € 7 million, largely driven
by sales completed in Slovakia in the previous quarter.

General administrative expenses

At € 749 million, general administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were up 9 per cent, or € 62 million, from € 687 million in
the previous quarter.

Staff expenses rose € 15 million in the fourth quarter to € 362 million. In addition to currency effects, this was mainly due to
higher wages and salaries, predominantly in Russia, Ukraine and the Czech Republic, whereas staff expenses in Poland and Asia
were down due to lower staff numbers.

Other administrative expenses increased € 48 million to € 293 million. This was in large part due to a seasonally-driven rise in
advertising, legal and advisory and consulting expenses in nearly all countries

Depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed assets fell € 1 million quarter-on-quarter to € 94 million. An impairment charge for
the Polbank brand was recognized in the previous quarter, while depreciation of tangible fixed assets was higher in the fourth
quarter, largely in Slovakia

Net provisioning for impairment losses

Compared to the third quarter, net provisioning for impairment losses rose € 151 million to € 251 million. The increase was mainly
attributable to Russia, Asia, Croatia, and the Group Corporates segment. In Russia, net provisioning for impairment losses was up
€ 60 million from the previous quarter due to a large individual case and to the implementation of a PD/LGD-based calculation of
portfolic-based loan loss provisions for retail customers. In Asia, loan loss provisions for corporate customers were up € 39 million
In Croatia, higher loan loss provisions both for corporate and for retail customers were responsible for the € 29 million increase. In
the Group Corporates segment, the provisioning requirement was € 24 million higher than in the previous quarter.

Overall, net individual loan loss provisioning rose € 116 million to € 226 million. Net portfolio-based loan loss provisions
amounted to € 28 million in the fourth quarter, while net releases of € 5 million were recognized in the third quarter.

The portfolio of non-performing loans to customers declined € 663 million from the previous quarter to € 6,486 million, primarily
due to sales of non-performing loans. On a currency-adjusted basis, the decline was € 778 million. There were reductions in
nearly all countries, most notably in Hungary (down € 215 million), Russia [down € 144 million], Asia (down € 112 million),
Poland (down € 70 million), and Ukraine (down € 55 million). The NPL ratio decreased quarter-on-quarter, from 10.2 per cent to
9.2 per cent, and the NPL coverage ratio was up 3.6 percentage points to 75.6 per cent.

Other results

Net income from derivatives and liabilities

Net income from derivatives improved € 16 million in the fourth quarter to minus € 55 million. This was mainly due to net income
from the valuation of derivatives entered into for hedging purposes; whereas net income from the change in credit spreads on own
issues came to minus € 12 million

Net income from financial investments

Net income from financial investments fell € 7 million in the fourth quarter to minus € 13 million, largely attributable to higher
impairment charges on equity participations.

Bank levies, non-recurring effects

Bank levies amounted to € 43 million in the fourth quarter (third quarter: € 34 million). The largest amounts were at Group head
office (€ 23 million] and in Poland (€ 9 million). The "Walkaway Law" came into force in Romania in the second quarter of 2016.
As a result of the expected take-up rate under the new law, a provision of € 43 million was recognized in May, with releases in
the amount of € 12 million in the fourth quarter and € 3 million in the third quarter.

Income taxes

Income tax expense decreased € 38 million quarteron-quarter to € 46 million, notably in Ukraine, Russia and Slovakia. The
effective tax rate was 33 per cent, up from 28 per cent in the previous quarter.

Statement of financial position

In the course of 2016, RBI's total assets declined 2 per cent, or € 2,563 million, to € 111,864 million. The reduction was attribut
able to changes in the scope of consolidation of around € 2,400 million, primarily as a result of the sale of the Polish leasing
company and the Slovenian subsidiary bank. Currency developments - predominantly the appreciation of the Russian rouble (up
25 per cent] and the US dollar {up 3 per cent) against the euro - resulted in a rise of around € 1,700 million.

Assets

loans and advances to banks before deduction of impairment losses (€ 50 million] fell 9 per cent over the year, or € 937 million,
10 € 9,900 million. This was primarily attributable to a decline of € 1,004 milion to € 1,412 million in receivables from the lend-
ing business, mainly at Group head office. In contrast, receivables from repurchase agreements and securities lending increased
€ 2,194 million to € 3,374 million

Loans and advances to customers before deduction of impairment losses (€ 4,905 million} increased 1 per cent, or € 593 million,
to € 70,514 million in the reporting period. In particular, this included a € 943 million net increase in loans and advances to retail
customers to € 25,578 million, while loans and advances to corporate customers declined € 195 million to € 44,277 million,
and loans and advances to sovereigns fell € 155 million to € 659 million. Loans to private individuals recorded a rise of € 1,514
million. This included an increase in mainly in Russia (primarily currency-related), in the Czech Republic (as a result of organic
growth in the lending and mortgage lending business and of the acquisition of Citibank's retail customer and credit card business),
and in Slovakia. The € 571 million decline in loans and advances to small and medium-sized entities to € 2,185 million was
attributable to the sale of the Polish leasing business. Declines in loans and advances to corporate customers in Asia and the US,
due to the planned reduction in business volumes, were largely offset by increases in the Czech Republic, in Russia [notably cur
rency-elated) and in Romania

The iter securities registered a decrease of € 1,253 million to € 16,972 million, notably at Group head office and in Poland. The
€ 2,065 million decline in other assets was mainly the result of the € 970 million reduction in the cash reserve (primarily at Group
head office), of the € 745 million reduction in assets available for sale pursuant to IFRS 5 (sale of the Slovenian subsidiary bank,
reclassification of Zuno}, and of the € 324 million reduction in trading and banking book derivatives.

Equity and liabilities

The volume of Group financing from banks (mainly commercial banks} decreased 22 per cent, or € 3,553 million, to € 12,816
million. Long-term and shortterm deposits declined, notably at Group head office and in Asia.

Deposits from customers increased 4 per cent, or € 2,547 million, to € 71,538 million in the course of the year. In particular,
deposits from retail customers increased € 4,885 million to € 38,529 million, while deposits from corporate customers declined
€ 2,089 million to € 31,554 million. The € 4,032 million increase in deposits from retail customers was attributable to private
individuals mainly in the Czech Republic (organic growth and purchase of a business unit), Russia, Slovakia and Romania, Depos-
its from small and medium-sized entities also rose, by € 853 million to € 5,949 million, notably in the Czech Republic and Slo-
vakia. The decline in deposits from corporate customers was mainly recorded at Group head office (repayments) as well as in
Poland and Slovakia due to the reduction of excess liquidity. In particular, deposits from large corporate customers reduced by

€ 2,083 million to € 28,561 million

Other liabilities fell € 2,328 million to € 14,073 million. Debt securities issued decreased € 856 million, primarily due to the
reduced refinancing required, while liabilities available for sale pursuant to IFRS 5 declined € 1,294 million (sale of the Slovenian
subsidiary bank, reclassification of Zuno}

Equity

Equity on the statement of financial position

Equity on the statement of financial position - consisting of consolidated equity, consolidated profit/loss and non-controlling
interests - increased 9 per cent compared to yearend 2015, or € 731 million, to € 9,232 million. This increase was mainly
attributable to total comprehensive income (€ 763 million), whereas dividend payments to non-controlling interests resulted in a
€ 40 million reduction in capital. No dividends were paid out to RBI's shareholders for the financial year 2015.

Total comprehensive income attributable to the Group of € 667 million comprises consolidated profit of € 463 million and other
comprehensive income of € 204 million. Exchange rate differences represented the largest item in other comprehensive income
and amounted to € 299 million in the reporting year (2015: minus € 185 million). Key drivers were the appreciation of the Rus-
sian rouble, which resulted in an increase of € 348 million, and the devaluation of the Polish zloty, which reduced equity by € 49
million. Since part of the equity in these currencies was hedged (capital hedge), the movement in the exchange rate also resulted
in a loss of € 43 million. The sale of Visa Europe Ltd. shares to Visa Inc. realized € 122 million, resulting in a net loss of € 70
million under the item net gains (losses) on financial assets available-for-sale.

. Capital of non-controlling interests rose € 47 million to

refer to note (47) Capital management and total capital accord-
ing to CRR/CRD IV and the Austrian Banking Act (BWG)

Common equity tier | after deductions stood at € 8,339 million. The increase from the 2015 comparable level totaled € 668 million,
mainly due to the inclusion of the net profit for 2016 and to positive currency effects, especially in relation to the Russian rouble. In
contrast, the application of transitional provisions for 2016 and the inability to continue to recognize the hybrid capital of RZB Finance
Jersey IV since May, due to the change in interest terms as stipulated in the prospectus, had a negative impact. Tier 2 capital declined

118 million compared to the previous year and totaled € 3,198 million. The decline was mainly attributable to matured tier 2
capital instruments in RBI AG. As at 31 December 2016, total capital under CRR amounted to € 11,537 million. This corresponds to
an increase of € 550 million compared to the 2015 yearend figure.

Total capital compared to a total capital requirement of € 4,805 million. The total capital requirement for credit risk amounted to
€ 3,907 million. The decline of € 209 million was based on the sale of Raiffeisen-Leasing Polska, Raiffeisen Banka d.d., Maribor,
the rating improvement in Belarus and Ukraine, and also on the reduction in exposures in the Non-Core segment. The total capital
requirement for position risk in bonds, equities, commodities and currencies came to € 214 million, a decline of € 27 million. The
decline of € 21 million in the total capital requirement for operational risk to € 684 million was attributable to the conversion of
larger units to the advanced approach

Based on total risk, the common equity tier 1 ratio (transitional) was 13.9 per cent, with a total capital ratio (transitional) of
19.2 per cent. Excluding the transitional provisions as defined in the CRR, the common equity tier 1 ratio (fully loaded) stood at
13.6 per cent, and the total capital ratio (fully loaded) was 18.9 per cent.

Research and development

As a universal bank, RBI is not involved in research and development in the strictest sense of the term.

In the context of financial engineering, however, it does develop customized investment, financing and risk hedging solutions for its
customers. Financial engineering encompasses not only structured investment products, but also structured financing, i.e. financing
concepts that go beyond the application of standard instruments and are used in areas such as acquisition or project financing.
RBI also develops individual solutions to hedge a broad spectrum of risks, from interest rate risk and currency risk through to com-
modity price risk. Besides financial engineering, RBI is also actively working on the further development of integrated product
solutions for international payment transfers within cash management.

In CEE, the RBI subsidiary banks in Slovakia and the Czech Republic are leaders in the mobile and online banking field. To learn
from the experiences and know-how in these markets, an extensive project to establish a Group-wide digital roadmap was
launched at the end of 2016

As part of innovation management, networking with ambitious star-up companies, renowned research institutes and original think.
ers provides new incentives and solutions for changing customer requirements, which are then placed at the disposal of the Raif-
feisen Banking Group. Here, too, the focus is on developing a culture of innovation and supporting the digital transformation of
the entire Raiffeisen Banking Group.

Internal control and risk management
system in relation to the Group
accounting process

Balanced and comprehensive financial reporting is a priority for RBI and its governing bodies. Compliance with all relevant
statutory requirements is of course a basic prerequisite. The Management Board is responsible for establishing and defining a
suitable internal control and risk management system that encompasses the entire accounting process while adhering to compa-
ny requirements. This is embedded in the company-wide framework for the internal control system (ICS)

The ICS is intended to provide the Management Board with the information needed to ensure effective and continuously improv-

ing internal controls for accounting. The control system is designed to comply with all relevant guidelines and regulations and to
optimize the conditions for specific control measures.

Raiffeisen Bank Interantional | Annual Report 2016

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the relevant Austrian laws, predominantly the Austrian
Banking Act [BWG) and Austrian Commercial Code (UGB], which govern the preparation of consolidated annual financial
statements. The accounting standards, used to prepare the consolidated financial statements, are the International Financial Re-
porting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU

Control environment

An internal control system has been in place for many years at the Group, which includes directives and instructions on key strate-
gic issues. It incorporates

= The hierarchical decision-making process for approving Group and company directives, as well as departmental and division-
al instructions.

= Process descriptions for the preparation, quality control, approval, publication, implementation, and monitoring of directives
and instructions.

® Regulations for the revision and repeal of directives and instructions.

The senior management of each Group unit is responsible for implementing the Group-wide instructions. Compliance with Group
rules is monitored as part of the audits performed by internal and local auditors.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared by Accounting & Reporting, which reports to the Chief Financial Officer. The
associated responsibilities are defined for the Group within the framework of a dedicated Group function.

Risk assessment

Significant risks relating to the Group accounting process are evaluated and monitored by the Management Board. Complex
accounting standards can increase the risk of errors, as can the use of differing valuation standards, particularly in relation to the
Group's principal financial instruments. A difficult business environment can also increase the risk of significant financial reporting
errors. For the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements, estimates have to be made for asset and liability items
for which no market value can be reliably determined. This is particularly relevant for credit business, equity participations, trade-
mark rights and goodwill. Social capital and the valuation of securities are also based on estimates.

Control measures

The preparation of individual financial statements is decentralized and carried out by each Group unit in accordance with the
RZB or RBI guidelines. The Group unit employees and managers responsible for accounting are required to provide a full presen-
tation and accurate valuation of all transactions. Differences in local accounting standards can result in inconsistencies between
the individual financial statements and the figures submitted to RBI. The local management is responsible for ensuring implementa-
tion of mandatory internal control measures, such as the separation of functions and the principle of dual control. The reconcilia-
tion and validation controls are imbedded in the aggregation, calculation and accounting valuation activities for all financial
reporting processes.

Group consolidation

The financial statement data, which are examined by an external auditor or undergo an audit review, are mostly entered directly
in, or automatically transferred to, the IBM Cognos Controller consolidation system by the end of January of the subsequent year.
The IT system is kept secure by limiting access rights.

The plausibility of each Group unit's financial statements is initially checked by the responsible key account manager within Ac-
counting & Reporting. Group-level control activities comprise the analysis and, where necessary, modification of the financial
statements submitted by Group units. In this process, the reports submitted by the auditor and the results of meetings with the repre-
sentatives of the individual companies where the financial statements are discussed are taken into account. The discussions cover
the plausibility of the individual financial statements as well as critical matters pertaining to the Group unit.

The subsequent consolidation steps are then performed using the consolidation system, including capital consolidation, expense
and income consolidation, and debt consolidation. Finally, intra-Group gains are eliminated where applicable. At the end of the
consolidation process, the notes to the financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS and the BWG/UGB.

In addition to the Management Board, the general control system also encompasses middle management. All control measures
constitute part of the day-to-day business processes and are used to prevent, detect and correct any potential errors or inconsist-
encies in the financial reporting. Control measures range from managerial reviews of the results for the period, as well as the
specific reconciliation of accounts, through to analyzing ongoing accounting processes

The consolidated financial statements and management report are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and
are also presented to the Supervisory Board for information. The consolidated financial statements are published as part of the
Annual Report on the company’s website and in the Wiener Zeitung's official journal and are then filed in the commercial register.

Information and communication

The consolidated financial statements are prepared using Group-wide standardized forms. The accounting and valuation stand-
ards are defined and explained in the RZB Group Accounts Manual and must be applied when preparing the financial state-
ments. Detailed instructions for the Group units on measuring credit risk and similar issues are provided in the Group directives. The
relevant units are kept abreast of any changes to the instructions and standards through regular training courses.

Each year the Annual Report shows the consolidated results in the form of a complete set of consolidated financial statements
These consolidated financial statements are examined by an external auditor. In addition, the Group management report contains
comments on the consolidated results in accordance with the statutory requirements.

Throughout the year, consolidated monthly reports are produced for the Group's senior management. Statutory interim reports are
produced that conform to the provisions of IAS 34 and are also published quarterly in accordance with the Austrian Stock Ex-
change Act. Before publication, the consolidated financial statements are presented to senior managers and the Chief Financial
Officer for final approval and then submitted to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. Analyses pertaining to the consolidated
financial statements are also provided for management, as are forecast Group figures at regular intervals. The financial and capi-
tal planning process, undertaken by Planning & Finance, includes a three year Group budget.

Monitoring

Financial reporting is a main focus of the ICS framework, whereby financial reporting processes with inherent misstatement risk are
identified and subject to additional monitoring and control reviews - the results of which are presented to the Management Board
and the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee for evaluation. The Management Board is responsible for ongoing company-wide
monitoring. In accordance with the target operating model, three successive lines of defense are established to meet the in-
creased requirements for internal control systems

The first line of defense is formed by individual departments, where department heads are responsible for monitoring their business
areas. The departments conduct control activities and plausibility checks on a regular basis, in accordance with the documented
processes

The second line of defense is provided by specialist areas focused on specific issues. These include, for example, Compliance,
Data Quality Governance, Operational Risk Controlling, and Security & Business Continuity Management. Their primary aim is to
support the individual departments when carrying out control steps, to validate the actual controls and to introduce state-ofthe-art
practices within the organization

Internal audits are the third line of defense in the monitoring process. Responsibility for auditing lies with Group Internal Audit at
RZB and also the respective internal audit departments of the Group units. All internal auditing activities are subject to the Group
Audit standards, which are based on the Austrian Financial Market Authority's minimum internal auditing requirements and interna-
tional best practices. Group Audit's internal rules also apply (notably the Audit Charter). Group Audit regularly and independenily
verifies compliance with the internal rules within the RZB Group units. The head of Group Internal Audit reports directly to the
Management Boards

Capital, share, voting, and
control rights

The following disclosures cover the provisions of § 243a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB):

(1] As at 31 December 2016, the company’s share capital amounted to € 893,586,065.90 and was divided into 292,979,038
voting common bearer shares. As at 31 December 2016, 509,977 of those were own shares, and consequently 292,469,061
shares were outstanding at the reporting date. In comparison with 31 December 2015 (557,295 shares], this results in a reduc-
tion of 47,318 shares and was based on the transferring of shares within the framework of the share-based remuneration pro-
gram. Please see note (32) for further disclosures.

(2) The Articles of Association contain no restrictions concerning voting rights or the transfer of shares. As RZB’s shareholders, the
regional Raiffeisen banks are parties to syndicate agreements regarding RZB AG. These syndicate agreements will be replaced
by anew syndicate agreement concluded by the regional Raiffeisen banks for RBI AG. The new syndicate agreement will take
effect on the effective date of the merger between RZB AG and RBI AG. The terms that the regional Raiffeisen banks intend to
incorporate in the new syndicate agreement include a block voting agreement, preemption rights and a prohibition on the sale of
RBI shares held by the regional Raiffeisen banks (with few exceptions) for a period of three years (lockup period) from the effec.
tive date of the merger between RZB AG and RBI AG, if the sale would directly and/or indirectly reduce the regional Raiffeisen
banks’ aggregate shareholding in RBI AG to less than 50 per cent of the share capital plus one share. After the lock-up period
expires, the shareholding threshold would fall to 40 per cent of the share capital of RBI AG

(3) As at 31 December 2016, RZB AG indirectly held around 60.7 per cent of the share capital of the company through its
wholly owned subsidiary Raiffeisen International Beteiligungs GmbH. By virtue of a syndicate agreement, the voting rights at-
tributable to RZB AG from the 177,847,115 shares in RBI AG are also assigned to the individual regional Raiffeisen banks as
syndicate partners and to their holding companies who have acceded to the syndicate agreement {in each case pursuant to § 91
and 8 92 7 of the Austrian Stock Exchange Act (BérseG}], which hold, in total, around 90.43 per cent of the share capital and
voting rights in RZB AG as parties acting in concert (see notification on voting rights published on 19 July 2016). The remaining
shares of RBI AG are held in free float, with no direct or indirect shareholdings amounting to 10 per cent or more known to the
Management Board. Please see the “Merger of RBI and RZB” chapter of the Annual Report with regard to the merger approved
at the Extraordinary General Meeting of RBI AG on 24 January 2017

(4) Pursuant to the company’s Articles of Association, RZB AG is granted the right to delegate up to one third of the Supervisory
Board members to be elected by the Annual General Meeting, as long as it holds an interest in the share capital. Beyond that,
there are no special rights of control associated with holding shares. At the Extraordinary General Meeting of RBI AG on 24
January 2017, a decision was made to remove the right to delegate members in § 9 of RBI AG's Articles of Association. The right
to delegate members will therefore cease to exist when the amendment to the Articles of Association is registered with the com-
mercial register. According to the syndicate agreement of the regional Raffieisen banks, the regional Raiffeisen banks will be able
to nominate nine members of the RBI AG Supervisory Board once the merger between RZB AG and RBI AG takes effect. In
addition to the members nominated by the regional Raiffeisen banks, the RBI AG Supervisory Board will in the future also include
three (previously: two) independent representatives of free-float shareholders who are not attributable to the Austrian Raiffeisen
Banking Group. This is to be implemented at the RBI AG Annual General Meeting in 2017.

(5) There is no control of voting rights arising from interests held by employees in the share capital

(6) Pursuant to the Articles of Association, a person who is 68 years or older may not be appointed as a member of the Man-
agement Board or be reappointed for another term in office. The rule for the Supervisory Board is that a person who is aged 75
years or older may not be elected as a member of the Supervisory Board or be re-elected for another term in office. Moreover,
no person who already holds eight supervisory board mandates in publicly traded companies ray be a member of the Supervi
sory Board. Holding a position as chairman of the supervisory board of a publicly traded company would count twice for this
purpose. The Annual General Meeting may choose to waive this restriction through a simple majority of votes if permitted by law.
‘Any candidate who has more mandates for, or chairman positions on, supervisory boards in publicly traded companies must
disclose this to the Annual General Meeting. There are no further regulations regarding the appointment or dismissal of members
of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board beyond the provisions of the relevant laws (with regard to RZB AG's right
to delegate members, please see point (4) above}. The Articles of Association stipulate that the resolutions of the Annual General
Meeting are, provided that there are no mandatory statutory provisions or Articles of Association to the contrary, adopted by a
simple majority of the votes cast. Where the law requires a capital majority in addition to the voting majority, resolutions are
adopted by a simple majority of the share capital represented in the votes. As a result of this provision, members of the Superviso-
ry Board may be dismissed prematurely via a simple majority. The Supervisory Board is authorized to adopt amendments to the

Articles of Association that only affect the respective wording. This right may be delegated to committees. Furthermore, there are
no regulations regarding amendments to the company Articles of Association beyond the provisions of the relevant laws.

(7) Pursuant to § 169 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Management Board has been authorized since the
Annual General Meeting of 4 June 2014 to increase the share capital with the approval of the Supervisory Board - in one or
more tranches - by up to € 446,793,032.95 through issuing up to 146,489,519 new common bearer shares with voting rights in
exchange for contributions in cash and/or in kind [including by way of the right of indirect subscription by a bank pursuant to

§ 153 (6) of AktG) by 25 August 2019 at the latest and to fix the offering price and terms of the issue with the approval of the
Supervisory Board. The Management Board is further authorized to exclude shareholders’ subscription rights with the approval of
the Supervisory Board (i) if the capital increase is carried out in exchange for contributions in kind or (ii) if the capital increase is
carried out in exchange for contributions in cash and the shares issued under the exclusion of subscription rights do not exceed 10
per cent of the company’s share capital (exclusion of subscription rights).

Pursuant to § 159 [2] 1 of the AkiG, the share capital has been increased contingently by up to € 119,258,123.20 through the
issue of up to 39,101,024 common bearer shares (contingent capital). The contingent capital increase will only be undertaken if
and when use is made of an irrevocable exchange or subscription right to shares granted by the company to creditors holding
convertible bonds issued on the basis of the resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on 26 June 2013 and the Manage-
ment Board does not decide to allocate own shares. Pursuant to § 174 (2) of the AkiG, the Annual General Meeting of 26 June
2013 authorized the Management Board to issue, in one or more tranches, convertible bonds in a total nominal amount of up to
€ 2,000,000,000, which grant holders conversion or subscription rights for up to 39,101,024 common bearer shares of the
company with a proportional amount of the share capital of up to € 119,258,123.20, within five years from the date of the
resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting, with the approval of the Supervisory Board. Shareholders’ subscription rights
to the convertible bonds are excluded. No convertible bonds have been issued to date.

The Annual General Meeting held on 16 June 2016 authorized the Management Board pursuant to § 65 (1) 8, § 65 (1a) and
§ 65 (1b) of the AktG to purchase own shares and to retire them if appropriate without requiring any further resolutions to be
passed by the General Meeting. Own shares, whether already purchased or to be purchased, may not collectively exceed 10
per cent of the company’s share capital. The authorization to purchase own shares expires 30 months after the date of the Gen-
eral Meeting resolution, ie. as of 15 December 2018. The acquisition price for repurchasing the shares may be no lower than
€ 1.00 per share and no higher than 10 per cent above the average unweighted closing price over the 10 trading days prior to
exercising this authorization. The authorization may be exercised in full or in part or also in several partial amounts, for one or
more purposes - with the exception of securities trading - by the company, by a subsidiary (§ 189a 7 of the UGB) or by third
parties for the account of the company or a subsidiary.

The Management Board was further authorized, pursuant to § 65 (1b) of the AktG, to decide, with the approval of the Supervisory
Board, on the sale of own shares by means other than the stock exchange or a public tender, to the full or partial exclusion of
shareholders’ subscription rights, and to stipulate the terms of sale. Shareholders’ subscription rights may only be excluded if the own
shares are used to pay for a contribution in kind, to acquire enterprises, businesses, operations or stakes in one or several compa-
nies in Austria or abroad, or for the purpose of implementing the company’s Share Incentive Program for executives and members of
the Management Boards of the company and affiliated companies. In addition, if convertible bonds are issued in accordance with
the Annual General Meeting resolution of 26 June 2013, shareholders’ subscription rights may also be excluded in order to issue
(own) shares to the holders of these convertible bonds who exercise the conversion or subscription rights granted them under the
terms of the convertible bonds to shares of the company. This authorization may be exercised in whole, in part or in several partial
amounts for one or more purposes by the company, a subsidiary (§ 189a 7 UGB) or by third parties for the account of the compa-
ny or a subsidiary and remains in force for five years from the date of this resolution, ie. until 15 June 2021

This resolution, any repurchase program based on it, or any resale program must be published along with the applicable duration
This authorization replaces the authorization granted at the Annual General Meeting of 4 June 2014 pursuant to § 65 (1) 4 and
8 of the AktG to purchase and use own shares and, with regard to their use, extends to the own shares already purchased by the
company. No own shares have been bought since the authorization was issued in June 2016.

The Annual General Meeting of 16 June 2016 also authorized the Management Board, under the provisions of § 65 (1) 7 of
the AktG, to purchase own shares for the purpose of securities trading, which may also be conducted off-market, during a period
of 30 months from the date of the resolution (i.e. until 15 December 2018}, provided that the trading portfolio of shares pur
chased for this purpose does not exceed 5 per cent of the company’s respective share capital at the end of any given day. The
consideration for each share to be acquired must not be less than half the closing price at the Vienna Stock Exchange on the last
day of trading preceding the acquisition and must not exceed twice the closing price at the Vienna Stock Exchange on the last
day of trading preceding the acquisition. This authorization may be exercised in full or in part or also in several partial amounts by
the company, by a subsidiary (§ 189a 7 UGB) or by third parties acting for the account of the company or a subsidiary. This
authorization replaces the authorization to purchase own shares for the purpose of securities trading that was granted in the
Annual General Meeting of 4 June 2014.

(8) The following material agreements exist, to which the company is a party and which take effect, change or come to an end
upon a change of control in the company as a result of a takeover bid

* Asa subsidiary of RZB, RBI AG is insured under RZB’s group-wide D&O insurance. Insurance cover remains in place in the
event of a merger with another legal entity of the RZB Group. In the event of a merger with a legal entity outside the RZB
Group, RBI AG will no longer be covered under the group-wide insurance from the date of the merger. In such cases, insur
ance cover only exists for claims for damages arising from breaches of obligations that occurred before the merger, which are
reported to the insurance carrier prior to any termination of RZB’s group-wide D&O insurance and thereafter within the agreed
notification period of five years.

= The company’s SIP provides the following upon a change in corporate control: “If a change in corporate control or a merger
occurs during the vesting period, and the combination does not exclusively concern subsidiaries, all contingent shares will
lapse without replacement at the time of acquiring the shares of RBI AG and the investor's effective power to dispose of them,
or at the time of the merger. An indemnification payment will be made for these contingent shares. The indemnity sum calculat-
ed will be paid out with the next possible salary payment.”

= Furthermore, the syndicate agreement concluded by RBI AG in relation to a subsidiary bank with a joint shareholder will auto-
matically be terminated upon a change of control.

= The brand agreement concluded with RZB AG (which will cease to exist once the merger is in effect) on the unrestricted use of
the name and logo of Raiffeisen Bank International for an indefinite period of time in all jurisdictions in which the brand is regis
tered now or in the future includes a right of cancellation upon a change of control.

= RBI AG is a member of the Professional Association of Raiffeisen Banks. Upon a change in control of RBI AG which results in
the attainment of control by a shareholder outside of the Raiffeisen Banking Group Austria, membership of the Professional As-
sociation of Raiffeisen Banks and of the Raiffeisen Customer Guarantee Scheme Austria may be terminated.

= The company’s refinancing agreements and agreements concerning third-party financing for subsidiaries, which are guaranteed
by the company, stipulate that the lenders can demand early repayment of the financing in the event of a change in control

Human Resources

Human Resources (HR} deals with the key corporate processes for managing personnel resources within the Group, taking both
the needs of employees and corporate interests into account. As at 31 December 2016, RBI had 48,556 employees (fulltime
equivalents), 2,936 or 6 per cent fewer than at the end of 2015. The majority of this reduction is attributable to developments in
Ukraine, Poland and Slovenia. The average age of employees remained relatively low at 37 years, and women accounted for
67 per cent of the workforce. Graduates make up 76 per cent of employees, indicating a highly skilled workforce

was initiated within the subsidiary bank to equip managers for
the challenges faced in an increasingly complex operating
environment and to facilitate growth

o

A similar program, "FIRE" (Freedom - Inspiration - Raiffeisen - Energy}, was also implemented in Hungary, focusing on key lead-
ership skills such as credibility and integrity, or resilience and inspiration

The subsidiary bank in Russia increased efforts to foster a positive culture of communication and cooperation among managers
and employees, for example, by implementing ad-hoc feedback and roundtable discussions on topical business issues.

Performance and talent management

The new performance management model for Group executives developed during 2015 was successfully implemented in 2016.
This included introducing clearly defined target categories (similar to a balanced scorecard approach) and improving consultation
between head office and Group units. Other measures included a new competence model and the intensification of dialog and
feedback. Based on these concepts, an international team developed the guidelines and fundamental principles for the new
performance management process for all other employee levels. Some subsidiary banks have already launched corresponding
pilot projects. In Hungary, for example, the focus was on increasing the level of individual responsibility with respect to target
definition and performance, as well as on regular and mutual feedback, coaching and staff development

The annual standard processes to identify and develop talent - each with varying local focal points - were carried out again in
2016. The intensive efforts produced results, with talent pipelines at all levels in almost all units. Data for Austria, for example,
shows that 39 per cent of talented individuals identified have advanced in their careers in the last two years [compared to 14 per
cent of other employees)

Employee survey

In 2016, around 40,000 employees participated in a Group-wide employee survey. The overall response rate was 87 per cent
Improvements were achieved for the two key factors employee engagement (commitment to the company and associated willing-
ness to voluntarily make additional effort) and employee enablement (existence of an environment which nurtures success). Of the
employees surveyed, 65 per cent felt committed to the company and 67 per cent felt their environment nurtured success. Com-
pared to the last Group-wide survey, this represents an increase of 4 and 3 percentage points respectively.

The results are now being used as a basis to develop further improvement measures. For example, the Management Board in
Hungary has defined four issues which will be given further attention. Each of the issues is being addressed by an interdisciplinary
team led by a member of first-level management, with expert support from the change facilitator and with a Management Board
member acting as sponsor.

Developments in compensation management

In order to more strongly reflect the critical importance of RBI's medium-term objectives and its capitalization in the compensation
system, the bonus system was further adapted in 2016 by expanding the “step-in" criteria for Group executives and adjusting the
criteria for target achievement.

A reduction in the variable compensation components of remuneration packages also led to new, nonfinancial concepts for
recognizing special achievements by employees being established. For example, a nonfinancial motivation program (starting with
a system of medical services} was launched in Belarus to improve employee commitment and reward long-serving employees,
while the “Success Celebration System”, which aims to strengthen team cooperation and collaboration between business areas,
was established in Hungary.

HR awards

The diverse measures taken by HR managers from the subsidiary banks designed to continuously improve HR functions and pro-
cesses were again recognized by a number of awards during the year under review. The Hungarian subsidiary bank, for exam-
ple, received the “Employer Partner Certificate” in recognition of high quality standards and “best HR practice”. Headhunters
ranked the Russian subsidiary bank among the "Top 10 best places to work” and the Head of HR was awarded the accolade
“Best HR director in the banking sector”. In Romania, the subsidiary bank's project “Inspire to Aspire Wakanda Challenge” pre-
vailed against 17 competitors and won an HR award in the category “Training and Development of People”. This program places
special emphasis on adapting leadership behavior. The Bulgarian subsidiary bank received the "Best HR project in a large com-
pany award” for the restructuring and modernization of its HR area. In the Czech Republic, RBI received the “HR Excellence
Award” which is awarded by HR managers and experts from 300 Czech companies. Finally, the Hungarian bank subsidiary
received the “Colibri Internship Award" as the best employer for interns.

Outlook

Economic prospects

Central Europe

Following somewhat weaker growth last year, growth in Central Europe (CE) is expected to pick up again in 2017. Ongoing
expansionary monetary policy in the region, a solid growth climate in the euro area and an expected recovery in investment
demand - amid continued strong private household consumer spending - should support this positive momentum. Leading the
way are Poland and Slovakia, each with projected growth of 3.3 per cent, closely followed by Hungary, whose economy should
grow by 3.2 per cent. In the Czech Republic, growth is forecast to reach 2.7 per cent.

Southeastern Europe

The Southeastern European (SEE) region is likewise expected to continue its growth trend. Following very strong GDP growth of
3.9 per cent in 2016, SEE should increase its economic output in 2017 by slightly more than 3 per cent, which is its current poten-
tial growth rate. In particular, Romania could continue its solid growth trajectory with GDP growth of 4.2 per cent, but momentum is
already slowing somewhat following last year's peak of over 4.8 per cent. Conversely, negative overheating effects such as a
ballooning current account deficit should be avoided as a result. Serbia and Croatia, the two countries showing the strongest eco-
nomic recovery in 2016, should both achieve economic growth of around or just over 3.0 per cent.

Eastern Europe

In Russia, moderate economic growth of 1.0 per cent is expected following the easing of the recession; a positive trend in oil prices
would further support the Russian economy. In Ukraine, a continuation of last year’s weak recovery process is anticipated whereas
the economy in Belarus is still expected to shrink slightly. In general, Eastern Europe currently lacks strong external and internal
growth drivers, as a result of which the region is not able to replicate the higher growth rates of the past. In addition, event risk
remains considerable.

Austria

In Austria, the moderate economic upturn in 2017 should continue and gain momentum. Domestic demand (private consumption,
gross capital investment) should continue to be the main pillar of support. The growth rate for exports should be higher than in
2016. Notwithstanding continuing solid growth in imports resulting from domestic economic momentum, net exports are expected
to continue to support GDP growth in 2017. This scenario implies a 1.7 per cent increase in real GDP, following 1.5 per cent in

2016.

CEE banking sector

Solid economic growth in CE and SEE - as well as the end of the recession in Russia and Ukraine - should have a markedly
positive impact on the CEE banking sector in 2017. Favorable developments in the operating business in CE and SEE could also
be supported by at least stable or even slightly improved interest margins and/or somewhat steeper yield curves in 2017. In
addition, recent years have already seen necessary adjustments for foreign currency loans and NPL portfolios resulting from the
earlier expansion in CE and SEE, as well as their negative income effects. Accordingly, return on equity in the CEE banking sector
should continue to recover in 2017.

Outlook for RBI

As a result of the merger with RZB, to be entered in the commercial register on 18 of March 2017, the following outlook applies
to the combined bank.

RBI reached the 12 per cent CET1 ratio target one year ahead of schedule with a fully loaded CET] ratio of 13.6 per cent at

1 December 2016 (12.4 per cent for the pro forma combined bank}. In the medium term we strive to achieve a CET] ratio (fully
loaded) of around 13 per cent.
After stabilizing loan volumes, we look to resume growth with an average yearly percentage increase in the low single digit area.

We expect net provisioning for impairment losses for 2017 to be below the level of 2016 (€754 million)

We look to reach an NPL ratio of around 8 per cent by the end of 2017, and over the medium term we expect this to reduce
further.

We further aim to achieve a cost/income ratio of between 50 and 55 per cent in the medium term, unchanged from our previous
target.

Our medium term return on equity before tax target is unchanged at approximately 14 per cent, with a consolidated return on
equity target of approximately 11 per cent.

Segment overview

Segmentation principles

Segment reporting at RBI is based on the current organizational structure pursuant to IFRS 8. A cash generating unit within the
Group is either a country or a business activity. Markets in Central and Eastern Europe are thereby grouped together into regional
segments comprising countries with comparable economic profiles and similar long-term economic growth expectations. Business
activities outside the CEE region are divided according to business area

This results in the following segments:

"Central Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia)
* Southeastern Europe (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Romania and Serbia)

"Eastern Europe (Belarus, Russia and Ukraine)

= Group Corporates (business with large Austrian and multinational corporate customers managed from Vienna}

= Group Markets (customer and proprietary capital markets related business managed from Vienna)

= Corporate Center (central management functions at Group head office and other Group units)

= Non-Core (business areas that are being discontinued or reduced: Asia, Poland, Slovenia, USA, and direct bank Zuno}

The segment reporting section in the consolidated financial statements contains details on segment classification

Details on the segmentation following the merger of RBI and RZB are provided in the merger chapter

In Central Europe, RBI increased total assets through greater new business generation, especially in the Czech Republic and
Slovakia. An additional increase resulted from the acquisition of Citibank’s retail and credit card business in the Czech Republic
(€ 669 million), which included a retail loan portfolio of € 201 million. The low level of interest rates, however, continued to nega-
tively impact operating income. Lower net provisioning for impairment losses in all countries in the segment, as well as income from
the sale of Visa Europe Ltd. shares to Visa Inc., led however to a significant improvement in profit before tax, which rose € 44
million year-on-year to € 354 million

Operating income

Net interest income decreased 4 per cent year-on-year, or € 25 million, to € 629 million due to persistently low market interest
rates. In Slovakia, net interest income declined € 23 million. Half of the € 14 million decline in Hungary was attributable to higher
interestHlike expenses in connection with the termination of an intra-Group mezzanine financing arrangement. In the Czech Repub-
lic, in contrast, net interest income increased € 12 million as a result of higher volumes. The net interest margin fell 36 basis points
year-on-year to 2.31 per cent due to interest rate adjustments relating to assets

Net fee and commission income declined | per cent yearon-year, or € 5 million, to € 383 million. Net income from the payment
transfer business reduced € 9 million to € 187 million as a result of lower margins, particularly in the Czech Republic, as well as
changes to regulations in Slovakia. Net income from the loan and guarantee business decreased 21 per cent, or € 9 million, to
€ 34 million due to legal restrictions on fees for early loan repayments in Slovakia and lower income in Hungary. Net income
from the management of investment and pension funds also fell € 6 million to € 15 million, largely as a result of a market-driven
decline in Slovakia. Net income from the foreign currency, notes/coins, and precious metals business, in contrast, increased € 14
million to € 95 million as a result of improved margins, primarily in the Czech Republic. Net income from the securities business
rose € 4 million to € 39 million, mainly due to higher income in the Czech Republic.

Net trading income fell 9 per cent, or € 3 million, to € 28 million. This included a € 6 million year-on-year decrease in net income
from interestbased transactions to € 3 million, attributable to valuation losses on interestbased derivatives in the Czech Republic.
Net income from currency-based transactions, in contrast, increased € 2 million year-on-year to € 26 million, primarily as a result
of valuation gains on derivatives and foreign currency positions in the Czech Republic and Slovakia

Recurring other net operating income improved slightly from minus € 25 million to minus € 24 million. Allocations to other provi-
sions increased in Slovakia, but were almost completely offset by a decrease in sundry operating expenses in all countries in the
segment.

General administrative expenses

The segment's general administrative expenses rose | per cent year-on-year, or € 7 million, to € 643 million. Staff expenses
increased 13 per cent, or € 36 million, to € 318 million, due to the purchase of Citibank’s retail and credit card business in the
Czech Republic as well as the expansion of a call center in Slovakia. Other administrative expenses decreased 6 per cent, or

€ 15 million, to € 250 million. The decline was largely the result of lower office space expenses ~ especially in Hungary, where
provisions were recognized in the previous year in connection with the closure of bank branches - and lower deposit insurance
fees, whereas communication and IT expenses increased. Contributions to bank resolution funds in the Czech Republic (€ 7
million), Slovakia (€ 6 million) and Hungary (€ 3 million] were up € 5 million yearonyear. Depreciation of tangible and intangi
ble fixed assets decreased 15 per cent, or € 14 million, to € 75 million, due to an impairment charge in the previous year's peri-
od in connection with branch closures and an impairment charge for software in Hungary. The segment’s number of business
outlets rose by 15 year-on-year to 410, with most of the increase taking place in the Czech Republic. The cost/income ratio
increased 2.6 percentage points to 63.3 per cent.

Net provisioning for impairment losses

Net provisioning for impairment losses in the Central Europe segment declined 71 per cent year-on-year, or € 95 million, to € 38
million in the reporting period. This included a € 79 million decrease in net allocations to individual loan loss provisions to € 38
million, while net allocations to portfolio-based loan loss provisions fell € 14 million to € 2 million. Most of this reduction was in
Hungary, where a net total of € 7 million of provisions were released during the reporting year. A decrease of € 63 million was
primarily attributable to sales of non-performing loans that were collateralized with real estate, as well as to rating improvements
and lower defaults in the corporate customer business. In Slovakia, net provisioning for impairment losses declined € 23 million to
€ 13 million due to loan sales and repayments in the corporate customer business. In the Czech Republic, net provisioning for
impairment losses decreased € 9 million yearonyear to € 32 million. Significantly lower portfolio-based loan loss provisions for
retail customers, due to new default probability rates implemented in the previous year, as well as improvements in the economic
environment and loan sales, were offset by higher individual loan loss provisions due to several defaults on the part of large
corporate customers.

The portfolio of non-performing customer loans fell € 254 million to € 1,077 million, primarily due to a reduction of € 249 milion

in Hungary following sales of loans. The proportion of non-bank non-performing loans in the Central Europe segment’s loan port

folio decreased 1.6 percentage points year-on-year to 5.5 per cent. The NPL coverage ratio declined 4.3 percentage points to
1.0 per cent

Other results and taxes
The Central Europe segments other results decreased € 11 million year-on-year to € 19 million

In the previous year, a provision of € 67 million was released in connection with the implementation of the Settlement Act (unilat
eral interest rate changes on consumer loans) in Hungary. There was a release of € 7 million in the reporting period

The bank levies contained in the other results increased € 3 million to € 38 million. The increase was evenly distributed between
Hungary and Slovakia

Net income from financial investments rose € 51 million year-on-year to € 47 million, mainly driven by the sale of Visa Europe Lid,
shares to Visa Inc., which closed in June and generated proceeds of € 56 million. Of this total, € 30 million was attributable to
Slovakia, € 19 million to the Czech Republic and € 6 million to Hungary. This was offset by an increase of € 6 million in impair-
ment charges for equity participations, primarily relating to Hungarian equity participations.

In the reporting period, net income from the disposal of Group assets amounted to € 7 million (2015: € 6 million). Most of the net
income posted in 2016 stemmed from the sale of a property leasing project in the Czech Republic.

Net income from derivatives and liabilities remained unchanged year-on-year at minus € 3 million and resulted from hedging to
adjust the currency and interest rate structure.

The segment's income taxes declined slightly year-on-year to € 64 million. The effective tax rate was 18 per cent in the reporting

period compared to 21 per cent in the previous year. The decrease is predominantly attributable to the utilization of tax loss
carryforwards in Hungary.

Net income in the Southeastern Europe segment improved, mainly due to the proceeds from the sale of Visa shares (€ 38 million}
and a € 50 million reduction in the negative impact of banking business costs following governmental measures. In the reporting
year, a new mortgage loan law in Romania resulted in expenses of € 27 million, while expenses of € 77 million had to be
booked in the previous year in connection with the conversion of Swiss franc loans in Croatia

Operating income

Net interest income decreased 5 per cent year-on-year, or € 42 million, to € 738 million. All of the segment’s countries - with the
exception of Bosnia and Herzegovina - reported lower net interest income, which was primarily attributable to the persistently
low interest rate level. The largest reduction (minus € 14 million) was reported in Albania, where declining lending volumes had
an additional dampening effect. The € 10 million drop in net interest income in Croatia also reflected a reduction in interest
bearing assets. The lower market interest rate level led to declines in net interest income of € 5 million in Romania and € 8 million
in Serbia. The segment's net interest margin ultimately fell 29 basis points to 3.55 per cent.

In contrast, net fee and commission income increased 3 per cent year-on-year, or € 10 million, to € 390 million. Net income from
the payment transfer business was up € 9 million to € 209 million due to a rise in income from the credit card business, mainly in
Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. Net income from the foreign currency, notes/coins and precious metals business
also increased € 4 million to € 85 million, largely as a result of higher volumes in Romania und Croatia. Net income from the sale
of own and third party products was up € 2 million to € 22 million, primarily in Romania. In contrast, net income from the securities
business fell € 4 million as a result of lower income, largely in Romania

Net trading income grew 7 per cent year-on-year, or € 4 million, to € 54 million in Southeastern Europe. Higher valuation gains
on foreign currency positions, mostly in Croatia, were mainly responsible for the € 4 million increase to € 34 million in currency-
based transactions, while Serbia and Albania reported valuation losses. Net income from interestbased business remained almost
unchanged

Recurring other net operating income improved € 17 million to € 21 million, primarily as a result of a € 20 million increase in net
income from the allocation to and release of other provisions (up € 13 million in Romania due to provisions for litigation in 2015)

Raiffeisen Bank International | Annual Report 2015

General administrative expenses

General administrative expenses fell 1 per cent year-on-year, or € 7 million, to € 674 million. Staff expenses remained virtually
unchanged at € 301 million. Increases in Bulgaria and Albania were offset by a decline in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The seg-
ment's other administrative expenses fell € 6 million to € 299 million. The decline was largely due to lower deposit insurance fees
in Romania and Bulgaria. In contrast, advertising, PR and promotional expenses, legal, advisory and consulting expenses and the
contributions to the bank resolution fund increased. Depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed assets decreased € | million,
mainly as a result of a reduction in depreciation of tangible fixed assets in Serbia. The cost/income ratio remained almost un-
changed at 56.0 per cent.

Net provisioning for impairment losses

Net provisioning for impairment losses declined € 16 million yearonyear, or 8 per cent, to € 175 million. Net individual loan loss
provisioning fell € 40 million to € 149 million, while portfolio-based loan loss provisions were up € 25 million to € 27 million. The
positive trend in individual loan loss provisioning was primarily attributable to loan sales, while the implementation of a PD-/LGD-

based calculation of the portfolio-based loan loss provisions in the retail customer business had a negative effect in further Group
units

The largest declines were reported in Bulgaria, Croatia and Serbia: In Bulgaria, net releases of loan loss provisions totaled

€ 1 million, after net provisioning for loan losses amounted to € 32 million in the previous year. The reduction was mainly due to
loan sales and lower portfolio-based loan loss provisions for retail customers due to the implementation of default probabilities in
the previous year. In Croatia, net provisioning for impairment losses was down € 14 million to € 22 million. The decrease was the
result of loan sales and releases of provisions for mortgage loans that had been recognized in connection with the conversion of
Swiss franc loans. In contrast, the implementation of a PD-/LGD-based calculation of the portfolio-based loan loss provisions for
retail customers had a negative effect of € 15 million. In Serbia, net releases totaled € 6 million, compared to net provisioning for
impairment losses of € 8 million in the previous year. This was due to the improved risk situation in the corporate customer busi-
ness, while the introduction of new default probabilities had a negative impact of € 6 million in the reporting year. In Romania, net
provisioning for impairment losses amounted to € 77 million, which was € 4 million more than in the previous year. The improved
tisk profile of corporate and retail customers had a positive effect, while the implementation of a PD-/LGD-based calculation of
portfolio-based loan loss provisions for retail customers resulted in an increase of € 18 million in net provisioning. In Albania, net
provisioning for impairment losses rose € 34 million to € 65 million, which mainly reflected defaults of several large corporate
customers, the revaluation of collateral (negative effect of € 7 million) and the PD/LGD-based calculation of portfolio-based loan
loss provisions for retail customers (negative effect of € 6 million).

Non-performing loans fell € 166 million to € 1,421 million, compared to yearend 2015. The biggest reductions were reported in
Bulgaria [down € 77 million] and Croatia [down € 72 million). The proportion of non-bank non-performing loans in the segment's
loan portfolio fell 1.6 percentage points to 10.5 per cent, while the NPL coverage ratio was up 8.1 percentage points to

797 per cent

Other results and taxes

Other results improved € 91 million to € 8 million. Net income from financial investments increased € 41 million year-on-year to
€ 46 million. This mainly reflected proceeds of € 38 million from the sale of Visa Europe Lid. shares to Visa Inc. in the reporting
year (€ 21 million in Romania, € 10 million in Croatia and € 7 million in Bulgaria), as well as a € 6 million increase in valuation
gains on securities in the fair value portfolio, primarily in Romania and Croatia

In the second quarter of 2016, the “Walkaway Law” entered into force in Romania. This resulted in a charge of € 27 million in the
reporting period. The new mortgage loan law stipulates that borrowers may transfer ownership of their properties to the banks and
thereby settle their debt, even if the loan exceeds the value of the property. The law relates to certain mortgage loans taken out by
private persons in any currency and applies retroactively. As RBI believes that this violates the Romanian constitution, legal action
has been initiated. In October 2016, the law was partially repealed by the Romanian constitutional court. As a result of the ruling,
an amount of € 12 million was released from the required provisioning of € 43 million in the fourth quarter. The releases amounted
to € 3 million in the third quarter.

In Croatia, expenses of € 77 million for governmental measures were recognized in the comparable period of 2015; while in the
reporting period, an expense of only € 10 million was incurred in connection with the conversion of Swiss franc loans. In this case
as well, an objection was filed against the law under the bilateral investment protection treaties. A decision is still being awaited.

The tax expense increased € 29 million year-on-year to € 62 million, while the effective tax rate was up 5 percentage points to
17 per cent. The rise was largely due to the use of loss carry-forwards in Croatia, where the tax expense increased € 21 million
to € 19 million and the effective tax rate was 24 per cent. In Bulgaria, the tax expense doubled to € 7 million for income-related
reasons, while the effective tax rate remained nearly unchanged at 9 per cent.

As in 2015, the Eastern Europe segment was again affected by a high level of currency volatility in the reporting period. The
average exchange rate of the Russian rouble was 7 per cent lower yearonyear, while the Ukrainian hryvnia and Belarusian
rouble were down 15 and 20 per cent respectively. On 1 July 2016, a currency reform came into effect in Belarus; the new
Belarusian rouble (BYN] replaced the old Belarusian rouble (BYR) at a rate of | to 10,000. In Ukraine, net trading income in-
creased € 85 million due to the more limited depreciation of the Ukrainian hryvnia, compared to the prior year, and an improved
result from foreign currency positioning. There were releases of provisions for impairment losses as a result of the improvement in
the risk situation, after very high provisioning was still necessary in the comparable period in 2015 due to the political situation in
the Donbass region. Profit before tax in Ukraine therefore increased € 241 million to € 150 million. In contrast, Russia reported a
16 per cent drop in profit before tax. A volume- and margin-related decline in net interest income was almost entirely offset by
lower general administrative expenses and net provisioning for impairment losses; however in 2015, net income from the disposal
of group assets of € 86 million was also recognized as a result of the sale of the Russian pension fund business, ZAO NPF Raif-
feisen. In Belarus, profit fell year-on-year due to a valuation result from a foreign currency position recognized in the previous year
and lower net income from proprietary trading,

Operating income

Net interest income was down 9 per cent year-on-year, or € 82 million, to € 866 million. This was mainly due to a decrease in net
interest income in Russia of 12 per cent, or € 80 million, to € 567 million. Apart from foreign currency effects, the decline was
primarily caused by a € 175 million decrease in interest income from derivative financial instruments entered into for hedging
purposes. This was a consequence of the lower interest rate level in 2016 (interbank interest rates in Russia were exceptionally
high in the first half of 2015) as well as lower volumes of USD swaps. In addition, interest income from loans and advances to
customers fell as a result of volume effects. In contrast, new retail business resulted in considerable margin-driven increases, particu-
larly due to the focus on local currencies. In Ukraine, the 3 per cent, or € 5 million, decline in net interest income to € 171 million
was entirely currency-related; in local currency, net interest income increased 14 per cent. In Belarus, net interest income rose just
€ 3 million to € 128 million, despite better margins, as a result of currency devaluations. The segment’s net interest margin im-
proved 46 basis points year-on-year to 6.60 per cent.

Net fee and commission income fell 3 per cent yearonyear, or € 12 million, 0 € 391 million. Net income from foreign currency,
notes/coins and precious metals business dropped 7 per cent, or € 8 million, to € 108 million - mainly as a result of currency
movements as well as lower volumes and margins in Belarus and Russia. Net income from the loan and guarantee business was
also down € 2 million to € 56 million - primarily as @ result of exchange rate effects in Ukraine and Belarus

Net trading income increased from € 31 million in the comparable period of 2015 to € 64 million. Net income from currency-
based business improved € 30 million to € 52 million. Ukraine reported a significant increase of € 81 million due to the more
limited depreciation of the Ukrainian hryvnia and foreign currency positions. Net trading income in Russia was also up on the
back of valuation gains on derivative financial instruments and foreign currency positions. In contrast, net trading income in Belarus
declined due to the closure of a strategic currency position that had led to a valuation gain of € 34 million in the previous year,
and a valuation- and volume-related fall in net income from open foreign exchange positions. Net income from interestbased
transactions increased € 3 million to € 12 million due to valuation gains on securities positions in Ukraine.

Recurring other net operating income was up € 15 million year-on-year to minus € 7 million, mainly as a result of a € 12 million
decline in other provisions in Russia due to branch closures in the previous year.

General administrative expenses

General administrative expenses fell 8 per cent yearon-year, or € 44 million, to € 519 million, Russia and Ukraine accounted for
most of the reduction, which largely reflected the depreciation of the Russian rouble and Ukrainian hryvnia. The € 16 million
decrease in staff expenses was based on currency devaluations and a lower headcount. Other administrative expenses fell

€ 24 million due to a decrease in legal, advisory and consulting expenses, as well as in office space expenses. The number of
business outlets in the segment fell by 91 to 771. Of these, 80 were in Ukraine. Depreciation was down € 4 million following
impairment charges for buildings in Ukraine in the previous year. The cost/income ratio improved 1.9 percentage points to

39.5 per cent.

Net provisioning for impairment losses

Net provisioning for impairment losses fell 61 per cent year-on-year, or € 258 million, to € 163 million. In Ukraine, net provision-
ing for impairment losses was down € 214 million; thus in the reporting year, there was a net release of € 2 million. This was
attributable primarily to the high provisioning requirements for loans to retail and corporate customers in the comparable period of
the previous year, due to the economic situation in the Donbass region and currency movements. In addition, restructuring and
loan sales reduced risk costs. The credit risk situation also improved in Russia in the retail and corporate customer areas; net provi-
sioning for impairment losses fell € 36 million to € 145 million. In Belarus, the provisioning requirement declined € 6 million to

€ 20 million due to a reduction in corporate customer loan volumes.

Compared to the start of 2016, the portfolio of non-performing customer loans in Eastern Europe declined € 326 million to

€ 1,576 million. The currency-adjusted fall was € 403 million. The biggest drop (€ 299 million) was reported in Ukraine, com-
pared to € 152 million in Russia. In contrast, non-performing loans increased € 47 million in Belarus. The proportion of non-bank
non-performing loans in the segment's loan portfolio fell 4.2 percentage points year-on-year to 14.7 per cent. The NPL coverage
ratio dropped 0.6 percentage points to 85.7 per cent.

Other results and taxes

Other results were down € 156 million to € 17 million year-on-year. The decrease was mainly due to net income from the dispos-
al of Group assets and from financial investments, which fell € 85 million and € 79 million respectively. In the previous year, net
income from the disposal of group assets of € 86 million was reported as a result of the sale of the Russian pension fund business;
in the reporting year, the result was € | million. The decrease in net income from financial investments to € 11 million resulted
primarily from lower valuation gains on securities in the fair value portfolio, mainly from fixed income government bonds in Ukraine
and bonds in Russia. In contrast, net income from financial derivatives rose € 7 million to € 4 million in the reporting year, as a
result of the valuation of interest rate swaps used to mitigate interest rate structure risk and changes in market values of banking
book derivatives, above all in Russia

The tax expense declined slightly to € 126 million. In Ukraine, the tax expense increased € 22 million as a result of the turna-

round, while it was € 15 million and € 9 million lower in Belarus and Russia respectively for income-related reasons. The effective
tax rate amounted to 19 per cent compared to 23 per cent in the previous year.

The improvement in profit before tax in the Group Corporates segment was mainly due to lower net provisioning for impairment
losses, after high provisions for impairment losses on loans and advances to large corporate customers - above all from the
Donbass region in Ukraine - were required in the previous year. This was set against declining operating income and higher
general administrative expenses.

Operating income

Net interest income declined 4 per cent, or € 13 million, to € 313 million. This was mainly due to lower loan volumes and declin-
ing margins in the corporate customer business (Austrian and multinational corporate customers serviced from Vienna). In addition,
interestlike extraordinary income declined after exceptionally high interestlike income, especially from real estate financing, was
reported in the previous year. The segment's net interest margin increased 8 basis points to 2.16 per cent.

Net fee and commission income declined 19 per cent, or € 14 million, to € 60 million. Lower fee and commission income from
export and investment financing, liquidity management services and bond trading, as well as a reclassification of net fee and
commission income items as net trading income was partly offset by higher net fee and commission income from bond issues.

The increase of € 7 million in net trading income was the result of the above-mentioned reclassification

General administrative expenses

General administrative expenses increased 7 per cent, or € 10 million, to € 153 million. The increase was due mainly to other
administrative expenses, which rose because of the pro rata allocation of the contribution to the bank resolution fund to the seg-
ment. The cost/income ratio increased 4.5 percentage points to 40.0 per cent.

Net provisioning for impairment losses

Net provisioning for impairment losses declined 47 per cent year-on-year, or € 66 million, to € 74 million. In the previous year,
individual provisions for losses on loans to large corporate customers, especially from the Donbass region, were significantly
higher. On a currency-adjusted basis, the portfolio of non-performing loans declined € 587 million to € 688 million, since the start

of the year, as a result of sales of loans. The proportion of non-bank non-performing loans in the segment’s loan portfolio fell 4.7
percentage points to 4.6 per cent. The NPL coverage ratio increased 9.2 percentage points to 65.9 per cent.

Profit before tax in the Group Markets segment declined 29 per cent. This was mainly due to higher net provisioning for impair-
ment losses. In contrast, the operating result increased 32 per cent due to improved net trading income resulting from higher busi-
ness volumes.

Operating income

Net interest income decreased 16 per cent, or € 12 million, to € 62 million. The excess liquidity in the market and the associated
lower credit demand had a negative effect in this respect. Interest income from loans and securities also decreased as a result of
lower volumes due to the reduction of a securities portfolio in the bank book. The net interest margin declined 17 basis points to
0.60 per cent

Net fee and commission income was down € 9 million yearon-year to € 113 million. Higher income from cash management was
offset by a decline in investment banking resulting from lower bond issuance volumes, reduced income from the securities business
due to lower volumes and margins, as well as the reclassification of income items from the securities business with institutional
customers as net trading income. In addition, income generated by Kathrein Privatbank AG in the securities business decreased

€ | million.

Net trading income increased € 44 million to € 122 million. Higher volumes in business with institutional investors had a positive
impact, while losses resulted from the abolition of the minimum exchange rate for the Swiss franc in the previous year. Despite the

withdrawal from individual markets and discontinuation of business with specific customer groups, a slight increase was also
reported in banknote trading due to improved margins.

Recurring other net operating income declined € 5 million to € 9 million due to lower sundry operating income
General administrative expenses

General administrative expenses declined 2 per cent, or € 4 million, to € 211 million. The cost/income ratio decreased
5.9 percentage points yearon-year to 69.0 per cent.

Net provisioning for impairment losses

Net provisioning for impairment losses amounted to € 34 million in the reporting period after a net amount of € 7 million was
released in the previous year. Non-performing loans (including to banks) declined € 284 million to € 131 million. The proportion
of non-performing loans in relation to the segments total credit exposure amounted to 1.9 per cent. The NPL coverage ratio
amounted to 71.9 per cent.

Other results and taxes
Other results declined € 10 million year-on-year to € 6 million due to a lower valuation result for bonds. This contrasted with
increased net income from derivative financial instruments resulting from the interest rate development. The expenses for bank

levies reported in the segment amounted to € 21 million, a year-on-year increase of € 3 million

Income tax expense posted an income-rlated decline of 32 per cent, or € 7 million, to € 15 million. The effective tax rate in the
reporting period was 23 per cent.

This segment principally comprises net income from Group head office governance functions and from other Group units. As a
result, its net income is generally more volatile. Profit before tax significantly declined - by € 657 million - in 2016. Operating
income mainly decreased due to lower dividend income. Net income from derivatives and liabilities declined, while there was an
increase in net income from financial investments and net income from the disposal of Group assets.

Operating income

Net interest income fell 68 per cent year-on-year, or € 762 million, to € 362 million. This was mainly due to a decline of

€ 604 million in dividend income from the Central and Eastern European Group units, after higher dividends were received in the
previous year, particularly from Russia (€ 479 million) and Croatia (€ 84 million). Interest income from intra-Group refinancing also
declined due to the decreasing financing volumes.

In contrast, net fee and commission income increased € 24 million year-on-year to € 42 million. This increase mainly resulted from
higher income from cash management, while net fee and commission income from the loan and guarantee business declined due
to lower volumes

Net trading income improved 83 per cent year-on-year, or € 122 million, to minus € 26 million. This was mainly due to a loss of
€ 70 million from a hedging transaction for dividend income in Russian roubles, booked in the previous year, and lower currency-

related valuation losses from a property company.

Recurring other net operating income fell 26 per cent, or € 40 million, to € 114 million. This decline primarily resulted from lower
income from intra-Group service charges.

General administrative expenses

General administrative expenses increased 7 per cent, or € 20 million, 10 € 326 million. This was largely driven by higher staff
expenses and the allocation of the contribution to the bank resolution fund to the segment.

Net provisioning for impairment losses

Net provisioning for impairment losses amounted to € 9 million in the reporting period, after a provisioning requirement of
€ 23 million for corporate customers at Group head office in the previous year.

Other results and taxes

Other results improved € 6 million to minus € 221 million

Raiffeisen Bank International | Annual Report 2015

Net income from the disposal of Group assets amounted to € 11 million in the reporting period, after a negative amount of
€ 49 million - mainly as a result of a provision booked for the sale of Raiffeisen Banka d.d., Maribor (€ 52 million) - was report
ed in the previous year.

The segment reported expenses for bank levies of € 42 million, which was € 7 million lower than in the comparable period in the
previous year

The negative development of net income from derivatives and liabilities, as a result of the valuation of bank book derivatives and
own issues, contrasted with improved net income from financial investments.

Tax income of € 32 million was posted in the segment in the reporting period after € 22 million in the previous year.

The Non-Core segment encompasses those business areas which are to be sold or reduced in line with RBI's strategic review, as
laid out in 2015. The sale of the Raiffeisen bank in Slovenia closed in June 2016, while the sale of Raiffeisen-Leasing Polska
closed in December 2016. When RBI acquired Raiffeisen Bank Polska S.A. (Raiffeisen Polbank} in 2012, it made a commitment
to the Polish regulatory authority (KNF) to list the shares of Raiffeisen Polbank on the Warsaw Stock Exchange with a free float of
at least 15 per cent by 30 June 2016. In May 2016, the KNF agreed that RBI could satisfy this commitment by selling Raiffeisen
Polbank to a listed Polish bank by the end of 2016. On 7 December 2016, the negotiations with Alior Bank S.A. regarding the
sale of Raiffeisen Polbank’s core banking business were terminated. RBI will now prepare the listing of 15 percent of Raiffeisen
Polbank, as agreed with the KNF, while also working on rightsizing the business model

The segment’s profit before tax improved 23 percent to minus € 203 million. This mainly resulted from lower net provisioning for
impairment losses on loans and advances, predominantly in Asia, and reduced general administrative expenses. Operating in-
come declined as a result of the planned reduction in volumes.

Operating income

Net interest income was down 14 per cent year-on-year, or € 54 million, to € 331 million. Asia reported the largest decline, with
a volume-related reduction of 56 per cent, or € 47 million, to € 37 million. The € 7 million decrease in Slovenia is attributable to

82

the sale of the Slovenian Raiffeisen bank. Net interest income in the US declined € 11 million to € 14 million due to the planned
reduction in business volumes. In contrast, in Poland, repricing measures in the deposit business increased net interest income by
4 per cent, or € 9 million, to € 262 million. The net interest margin improved 11 basis points to 2.12 per cent.

Net fee and commission income declined 10 per cent year-on-year, or € 18 million, to € 154 million. Net income from the loan
and guarantee business decreased € 12 million to € 22 million as a result of lower volumes, primarily in Asia, Slovenia and
Poland. Net income from the foreign currency, notes/coins, and precious metals business fell € 5 million to € 68 million due to a
reduction of income in Poland. Net income from the payment transfer business dropped € 4 million, primarily in Asia and Slovenia.
In contrast, net income from the sale of own and third party products increased € 4 million to € 27 million, mainly in Poland

Net trading income was down € 5 million year-on-year to minus € 5 million. Net income from currency-based transactions de-
clined € 3 million due to valuation losses on foreign currency positions in Poland. Net income from interestbased transactions
declined € 3 million, primarily in Poland

Recurring other net operating income declined € 20 million to almost zero due to losses from the disposal of tangible and intan-
gible fixed assets in Poland (negative impact of € 5 million), lower income from the allocation and release of other provisions
(down € 5 million], higher other operating expenses (up € 8 million], especially in Poland, and lower net income from non-
banking activities [down € 4 million)

General administrative expenses

General administrative expenses dropped 12 per cent, or € 57 million, to € 406 million. Staff expenses decreased 6 per cent, or
€ 11 million, to € 187 million, primarily due to the windown in Asia and the sale of the subsidiary bank in Slovenia. Other admin-
istrative expenses declined 22 per cent, or € 44 million, to € 154 million. This decrease was based on lower deposit insurance
fees due to an exceptional payment relating to the default of a Polish bank in the previous year. Furthermore, a one-off payment
was made in the previous year to a mortgage borrowers’ support fund in Poland. Depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed
assets fell 3 per cent, or € 2 million, to € 65 million. The Polbank brand's residual value of € 26 million was written off in the
reporting year due to the results of the endeavors to sell the company. In the previous year, a partial impairment of € 21 million
was recognized in relation to the Polbank brand. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets, in contrast, was lower. The number of
business outlets fell by 73 to 305, with most of the decline occurring in Poland [down 58) and Slovenia (down 13). The
cost/income ratio rose 4.4 percentage points to 84.6 per cent.

Net provisioning for impairment losses

Net provisioning for impairment losses declined 32 per cent year-on-year, or € 120 million, to € 255 million. This development
was mainly attributable to Asia, where net provisioning for loans to large corporate customers declined € 118 million to

€ 179 million. Net provisioning for impairment losses in Poland fell € 4 million year-on-year to € 40 million. This was primarily due
to an improvement in the credit risk situation of corporate customers. In Slovenia, a net amount of € 2 million in provisions was
released before the bank was sold in the middle of the year, as compared to the previous year when net provisioning was

€ 19 million. In the US, net provisioning for corporate customers who had already defaulted amounted to € 36 million (up

€ 23 million)

The portfolio of non-performing loans decreased € 268 million since the start of the year to € 1,634 million, with a decline of
€ 222 million on a currency-adjusted basis. The largest reduction was recorded in Slovenia (decline of € 121 million) due to the
sale of the Slovenian subsidiary bank. In Poland, the decline was € 38 million, € 37 million in the US, and € 29 million in Asia
The proportion of non-bank non-performing loans in the segment’s loan portfolio increased 2.3 percentage points year-on-year to
17.7 per cent. The NPL coverage ratio rose 4.2 percentage points to 66.6 per cent.

Other results and taxes
The segment's other results fell € 19 million year-on-year to minus € 22 million. Expenses of € 34 million for the newly.inttoduced
bank levy in Poland had a negative impact. Net income from financial investments primarily increased due to € 22 million resulting

from the sale of Visa Europe Lid. shares to Visa Inc. {in Poland: € 18 million, ZUNO BANK AG: € 4 million)

Tax expense increased 73 per cent year-on-year, or € 17 million, to € 41 million as a result of the write off of tax assets from prior
periods in Poland. The effective tax rate for the segment was 20 per cent.
